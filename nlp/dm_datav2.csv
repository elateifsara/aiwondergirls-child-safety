As of 29 October 2020, 44,351,506 glob-ally confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported on the World Health Organization COVID-19 dash-board, including 1,171,255 deaths. The fatality rate for  COVID-19 has been estimated to be 0.5–1.0%1–3. From 1 March to 30 May 2020, 122,300 excess all- cause deaths occurred in the USA, of which 95,235 (79%) were offi-cially attributed to COVID-19 (ref.4). Of note, mortality from COVID-19 and seasonal influenza is not equiv-alent, as deaths associated with these diseases do not reflect frontline clinical conditions in the same way. For example, COVID-19 pandemic- hit areas have been fac-ing critical shortages in terms of access to supplies such as ventilators and intensive care unit (ICU) facilities5.', 'SARS- CoV-2 is a positive- stranded RNA virus that is enclosed by a protein- decorated lipid bilayer con-taining a single- stranded RNA genome; SARS- CoV-2 has 82% homology with human SARS- CoV, which causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)6. In human cells, the main entry receptor for SARS- CoV-2 is angiotensin- converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)7, which is highly expressed in lung alveolar cells, cardiac myocytes, vascular endothelium and various other cell types8. In humans, the main route of SARS- CoV-2 transmission is through virus- bearing respiratory droplets9. Generally, patients with COVID-19 develop symptoms at 5–6 days after infection. Similar to SARS- CoV and the related Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS)- CoV, SARS- CoV-2 infection induces mild symptoms in the initial stage for 2 weeks on average but has the poten-tial to develop into severe illness, including a systemic inflammatory response syndrome, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multi- organ involvement and shock10. Patients at high risk of severe COVID-19 or death have several characteristics, including advanced age and male sex, and have underlying health issues, such as cardiovascular disease (CVD), obesity and/or  type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)11–13. A few early studies have shown that underlying CVD and diabetes mellitus are com-mon among patients with COVID-19 admitted to ICUs14,15. T2DM is typically a disease of advanced age, ', 'COVID-19 and diabetes mellitus: from pathophysiology to clinical managementSoo\xa0Lim  1,5\u2009✉, Jae\xa0Hyun\xa0Bae  2,5, Hyuk- Sang\xa0Kwon  3 and Michael\xa0A.\xa0Nauck  4\u2009✉', 'Abstract | Initial studies found increased severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),  caused by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS- CoV-2),  in patients with diabetes mellitus. Furthermore, COVID-19 might also predispose infected individuals to hyperglycaemia. Interacting with other risk factors, hyperglycaemia might modulate immune and inflammatory responses, thus predisposing patients to severe COVID-19 and possible lethal outcomes. Angiotensin- converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is part of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS), is the main entry receptor for SARS- CoV-2; although dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) might also act as a binding target. Preliminary data, however, do not suggest a notable effect of glucose- lowering DPP4 inhibitors on SARS- CoV-2 susceptibility. Owing to their pharmacological characteristics, sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors might cause adverse effects in patients with COVID-19 and so cannot be recommended. Currently, insulin should be the main approach to the control of acute glycaemia. Most available evidence does not distinguish between the major types of diabetes mellitus  and is related to type 2 diabetes mellitus owing to its high prevalence. However, some limited evidence is now available on type 1 diabetes mellitus and COVID-19. Most of these conclusions are preliminary, and further investigation of the optimal management in patients with diabetes mellitus is warranted.✉e- mail: limsoo@snu.ac.kr; michael.nauck@rub.dehttps://doi.org/10.1038/ s41574-020-00435-4', 'REVIEWSnaTure revIewS | ENDOCRINOlOGy  volume 17 | January 2021 | 11https://covid19.who.int/https://covid19.who.int/http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4137-1671http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1384-6123http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4026-4572http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5749-6954mailto:limsoo@snu.ac.krmailto:michael.nauck@rub.dehttps://doi.org/10.1038/s41574-020-00435-4https://doi.org/10.1038/s41574-020-00435-4http://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1038/s41574-020-00435-4&domain=pdfand, therefore, whether diabetes mellitus is a COVID-19 risk factor over and above advanced age is currently  unknown.', 'The basic and clinical science of the potential inter- relationships between diabetes mellitus and COVID-19 has been reviewed16. However, knowledge in this field is emerging rapidly, with numerous publica-tions appearing frequently. This Review summarizes the new advances in diabetes mellitus and COVID-19 and extends the focus towards clinical recommendations for patients with diabetes mellitus at risk of or affected by COVID-19. Most available research does not distinguish between diabetes mellitus type and is mainly focused on T2DM, owing to its high prevalence. However, some limited research is available on COVID-19 and T1DM, which we highlight in this Review.', 'Potential mechanismsThe presence of diabetes mellitus and the individual degree of hyperglycaemia seem to be independently associated with COVID-19 severity and increased mortality11,12,17,18. Furthermore, the presence of typical complications of diabetes mellitus (CVD, heart fail-ure and chronic kidney disease) increases COVID-19 mortality11,19. We propose some pathophysiological mechanisms leading to increased cardiovascular and all- cause mortality after infection with SARS- CoV-2 in patients with diabetes mellitus (fig.\xa01).', 'COVID-19 and glucose metabolism. In human monocytes, elevated glucose levels directly increase SARS- CoV-2 replication, and glycolysis sustains SARS- CoV-2 replication via the production of mito-chondrial reactive oxygen species and activation of hypoxia- inducible factor 1α20. Therefore, hypergly-caemia might support viral proliferation. In accord with this assumption, hyperglycaemia or a history of T1DM and T2DM were found to be independent predictors of morbidity and mortality in patients with SARS21. Furthermore, comorbid T2DM\xa0in mice infected with MERS- CoV resulted in a dysregulated immune response, leading to severe and extensive lung pathol-ogy22. Patients with diabetes mellitus typically fall into higher categories of SARS- CoV-2 infection severity than those without23,24, and poor glycaemic control predicts an increased need for medications and hospitalizations, and increased mortality18,25 (Table\xa01; Supplementary Table 1).', 'Of note, glycaemic deterioration is a typical compli-cation of COVID-19 in patients with impaired glucose regulation or diabetes mellitus. For example, in patients requiring insulin, SARS- CoV infection was associated with a rapidly increasing need for high doses of insu-lin (often approaching or exceeding 100 IU per day)26. Changes in insulin needs are seemingly associated with the levels of inflammatory cytokines26,27. Although ketoacidosis is typically a problem closely associated with T1DM, in patients with COVID-19, ketoacidosis can also occur in those with T2DM. For example, in a systematic review, 77% of patients with COVID-19 who developed ketoacidosis had T2DM28.', 'Inflammation and insulin resistance. The most com-mon post- mortem findings in the lungs of people with fatal COVID-19 are diffuse alveolar damage and inflammatory cell infiltration with prominent hyaline membranes29. Other critical findings include myocar-dial inflammation, lymphocyte infiltration in the liver, macrophage clustering in the brain, axonal injuries, microthrombi in glomeruli and focal pancreatitis29. These findings indicate an inflammatory pathology in COVID-19 (fig.\xa01). In addition, an integrated analy-sis showed that patients with severe COVID-19 have a highly impaired interferon type I response with low IFNα activity in the blood, indicating high blood viral load, and an impaired inflammatory response30. It has also been reported that the inborn errors of type I interferon immunity related to TLR3 and IRF7 (ref.31), or B\xa0cell immunity32, underlie fatal COVID-19 pneu-monia in 12.5% of men and 2.6% of women. The afore-mentioned findings indicate considerable variations in immune phenotypes among patients with COVID-19.', 'Some patients with severe COVID-19 experience a cytokine storm, which is a dangerous and potentially life- threatening event33,34. A retrospective study of 317\xa0patients with laboratory- confirmed COVID-19 showed the presence of active inflammatory responses (IL-6 and lactate dehydrogenase) within 24 h of hos-pital admission, which were correlated with disease severity35. Furthermore, blood levels of IL-6 and lactate dehydrogenase are independent predictors of COVID-19 ', 'Key points•\tunderlying diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases are considered risk factors for increased coronavirus disease 2019 (CovID-19) disease severity and worse outcomes, including higher mortality.•\tPotential pathogenetic links between CovID-19 and diabetes mellitus include effects on glucose homeostasis, inflammation, altered immune status and activation of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (raaS).•\tDuring the CovID-19 pandemic, tight control of glucose levels and prevention of diabetes complications might be crucial in patients with diabetes mellitus to keep susceptibility low and to prevent severe courses of CovID-19.•\tevidence suggests that insulin and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors can be used safely in patients with diabetes mellitus and CovID-19; metformin and sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors might need to be withdrawn in patients at high risk of severe disease.•\tPharmacological agents under investigation for the treatment of CovID-19 can affect glucose metabolism, particularly in patients with diabetes mellitus; therefore, frequent blood glucose monitoring and personalized adjustment of medications are required.•\tas CovID-19 lacks definitive treatment so far, patients with diabetes mellitus should follow general preventive rules strictly and monitor glucose levels more frequently, engage in physical activity, eat healthily and control other risk factors.', 'Cytokine storman uncontrolled excessive production of markers of inflammation, followed by an abnormal inflammatory response, which results from the effects of a combination  of pro- inflammatory immunoactive molecules, such as interleukins, interferons, chemokines and tumour necrosis factor.', 'Author addresses', '1Department of Internal medicine, Seoul national university Bundang Hospital, Seoul national university College of medicine, Seongnam, South Korea.2Department of Internal medicine, Korea university anam Hospital, Korea university College of medicine, Seoul, South Korea.3Department of Internal medicine, yeouido St mary’s Hospital, The Catholic university of Korea, Seoul, South Korea.4Diabetes Division, Katholisches Klinikum Bochum, St Josef- Hospital (ruhr- universität Bochum), Bochum, Germany.5These authors contributed equally to this work: Soo lim, Jae Hyun Bae.www.nature.com/nrendo', 'R e v i e w s', '12 | January 2021 | volume 17 severity35. Of note, IL-6 has pro- inflammatory proper-ties in innate immunity, and its levels can correlate with both the degree of disease severity and with a procoag-ulant profile36. Through increasing oxidative stress, IL-6 can damage proteins, lipids and DNA, and impair the body’s structure and function, and we propose that this effect might lead to rapid progression of COVID-19 in patients with diabetes mellitus (fig.\xa01). Notably, a sys-tems biological assessment of immunity in patients with severe COVID-19 showed increased levels of bacterial DNA and lipopolysaccharide in the plasma37, which were positively correlated with the plasma levels of IL-6 as well as EN- RAGE, a biomarker of pulmonary injury that is implicated in the pathogenesis of sepsis- induced ARDS38. These findings suggest a role for bacterial products, per-haps of lung origin, in augmenting the production of inflammatory cytokines in severe COVID-19.', 'Several mechanisms have been proposed by which virally induced inflammation increases insu-lin resistance39. For example, in coronavirus- induced pneumonia, such as SARS and MERS, inflammatory cells infiltrate the lungs, leading to acute lung injury, ARDS and/or death40. This large burden of inflamma-tory cells can affect the functions of skeletal muscle and the liver, the major insulin- responsive organs that are responsible for the bulk of insulin- mediated glucose uptake41. In\xa0addition, patients with severe COVID-19 show muscle weakness and elevation of liver enzyme activities, which might suggest multiple organ failure, particularly during a cytokine storm42.', 'COVID-19 can progress to ARDS, which requires positive pressure oxygen and intensive care therapy9. ARDS is characterized by severe oedema of the alveolar wall and lung parenchyma, accompanied by a marked rise in inflammatory parameters, such as C- reactive pro-tein levels and erythrocyte sedimentation rates. Patients with COVID-19 also exhibit elevation of other inflam-matory markers, such as D- dimer, ferritin and IL-6 (ref.43), which might contribute to an increased risk of microvascular and macrovascular complications origi-nating from low- grade vascular inflammation in patients with underlying diabetes mellitus44. In a nationwide study in France, microvascular and macrovascular com-plications of diabetes mellitus were significantly asso-ciated with increased risk of mortality in patients with COVID-19 (ref.45). Whether COVID-19 accelerates the progression of diabetic complications needs to be stud-ied. Thus, the molecular pathogenesis of SARS- CoV-2 is related to oxidative stress and inflammation, which can contribute to sepsis progression (fig.\xa01).', 'Infection withSARS-CoV-2↑ Inflammatory cytokines(↑ toxic metabolites)↑ Lipopolysaccharide↑ Natural killer cell (IFNγ)↑ ROS↑ IL-6↑ RAAS(↑ angiotensin II)↑ Fibrinogen↑ D-dimer', 'Lung fibrosisInterstitial and/or vascularpermeability for pro-inflammatory product', 'Insulin resistance', 'Acute lung damageand ARDS', 'Hyperglycaemia Vascular endothelialdamage ↑ Blood viscosity• Cardiovascular events• Thromboembolism and DIC', 'Cardiovascular and all-cause mortality', 'Fig. 1 | Potential pathogenic mechanisms in patients with T2DM and COVID-19.

Modulation of natural killer cell activity (increased9,39,50 or decreased242,244) and IFNγ production can increase the interstitial and/or vascular permeability for pro- inflammatory products243,245,246. In addition, infection with SARS- CoV-2 leads to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production243,247,248. These effects lead to lung fibrosis249, acute lung damage and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)9,250. ROS production and viral activation of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS)249,251 (via increased angiotensin II expression) cause insulin resistance39,252, hyperglycaemia253 and vascular endothelial damage243,254,255, all of which contribute to cardiovascular events, thromboembolism and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

It is recognized that mechanisms linking COVID-19 and both T1DM and T2DM over-lap with pathways that regulate immune function16. For example, age is the strongest risk factor for developing T2DM and the effect of ageing on immune function might be equally important for COVID-19 suscepti-bility and severity. Hyperglycaemia can affect immune function; conversely, a dysregulated immunological sta-tus is linked to macrovascular complications of diabetes mellitus46,47. Thus, T2DM is associated with immuno-logical dysregulation, which is potentially equivalent to accelerated ageing, and could therefore potentially explain the poor prognosis in patients with diabetes mellitus and COVID-19 (fig.\xa01).', 'In individuals with obesity, pro- inflammatory cytokines with a T helper type 1 cell signature are known to increase insulin resistance48; however, the role of such cytokines in COVID-19 is unclear. Whether and how SARS- CoV-2 infection induces loss of glycaemic con-trol in patients who are at risk of developing diabetes mellitus is also unclear. One study demonstrated that acute respiratory virus infection increases IFNγ pro-duction, and it causes muscle insulin resistance in humans, which drives compensatory hyperinsulinae-mia to maintain euglycaemia and to boost antiviral CD8+ T\xa0cell responses39. It can be hypothesized that in patients with impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes mellitus, such compensation might fail49. Of note, hyper-insulinaemia can increase antiviral immunity through direct stimulation of CD8+ effector T\xa0cell function39. In prediabetic mice with hepatic insulin resistance caused by diet- induced obesity, murine cytomegalovirus infec-tion resulted in a deterioration of glycaemic control39. Thus, during SARS- CoV-2 infection, the ensuing anti-viral immune and inflammatory responses can change insulin sensitivity, potentially aggravating impairments of glucose metabolism (fig.\xa01).', 'Interestingly, respiratory syncytial viruses increase the production of IFNγ, which activates natural killer (NK) cells as a defensive mechanism50. Both increased production of IFNγ and activated NK cells exacerbate systemic inflammation in muscle and adipose tissues, overall establishing a detrimental effect on glucose uptake51. Furthermore, a relationship exists between NK cell activity and glucose control in patients with impaired glucose metabolism. For example, NK cell activity was lower in patients with T2DM than in those with predi-abetes or normal glucose tolerance52. In addition, mul-tiple regression analysis showed that the HbA1c level is an independent predictor of NK cell activity in patients with T2DM52. Thus, individuals with impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes mellitus have reduced NK cell activity, which might help to explain why patients with diabetes mellitus are more susceptible to COVID-19 ', 'Region Study design Age (years; mean or median)', 'Number (women/men)', 'Glycaemic status, HbA1c (%) (proportion)', 'Comorbidities (%) Main findings Ref.', 'T2DM (cont.)', 'UK (England)', 'Population- based cohort study', '67.5 ± 13.4 2,874,020 (1,267 ,590/ 1,606,430)<6.5 (25%)6.5–7.0 (21%)', '7.1–7.5 (13%)', '7.6–9.9 (25%)≥10.0 (11%)', 'HTN (SBP >140 mmHg (67); antihypertensive agents (76))', 'CKD (18)', 'MI (2)stroke (2)', 'HF (5)', 'COVID-19- related deaths: 10,525', 'Risk factors for mortality: male sex, older age, renal impairment, non- white ethnicity, socioeconomic deprivation, previous stroke, previous HF, HbA1c ≥7.5% or <6.5% (reference range 6.5%–7.0%), BMI (U- shaped, reference range 25.0–29.9 kg/m2)', '11', 'UK (England)', 'Whole population study', '67.4 ± 13.4 2,864,670 (1,263,615/ 1,601,045)', 'No glycaemic data', 'CHD (19)', 'CeVD (7)', 'HF (6)', 'COVID-19- related deaths: 7 ,434', '72-day mortality: 260 (95% CI 254−264) per 100,000 peopleMortalityb: OR 2.03 (95% CI 1.97−2.09)', '19', 'China Retrospective cohort study', '63.0 (56.0–69.0)', '1,213 (632/581)', 'Glucose 8.6 (6.5–12.5) mmol/l', 'CHD (15)', 'HF (0.2)', 'CeVD (4)', 'Metformin versus non- metformin', 'Acidosis: HR 2.73 (95% CI 1.04−7.13)Lactic acidosis: HR 4.46 (95% CI 1.11−18.00)Mortality: HR 1.65 (95% CI 0.71−3.86)ARDS: HR 0.85 (95% CI 0.61−1.17)DIC: HR 1.68 (95% CI 0.26−10.90)Acute kidney injury: HR 0.65 (95% CI 0.19−2.24)Acute heart injury: HR 1.02 (95% CI 0.62−1.66)', '214', 'Major studies are included; for a more comprehensive list of studies, please refer to Supplementary Table 1.

In summary, understanding the immuno-modulation occurring during SARS- CoV-2 infection is crucial for identifying therapeutic targets and devel-oping effective\xa0medications as well as understanding its pathogenesis.', 'Renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system. As a part of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) (fig.\xa01), ACE2 has already received much attention as it can also serve as an entry receptor for SARS- CoV as well as SARS- CoV-2 (ref.53). ACE2 was initially reported to be predominantly expressed in the respiratory system53. However, a more sophisticated study using immuno-histochemical analyses found that ACE2 is expressed mainly in the intestines, kidneys, myocardium, vas-culature and pancreas, but expression is limited in the respiratory system54. Evidence therefore suggests that ACE2 is expressed in many human cells and tissues, including pancreatic islets55. Studies using samples from patients with COVID-19 are warranted to investigate the colocalization of SARS- CoV-2 and ACE2 and help in understanding the progression of COVID-19 and the viral pathogenesis of SARS- CoV-2.', 'Some evidence suggests an association between ACE2 and glucose regulation. For example, Ace2- knockout mice have been found to be more susceptible than wild- type mice to high- fat diet- induced pancreatic β- cell dysfunction56. Furthermore, infection with SARS- CoV can cause hyperglycaemia in people without pre- existing diabetes mellitus57. This finding and the localization  of ACE2 expression in the endocrine pancreas together suggest that coronaviruses might specifically damages islets, potentially leading to hyperglycaemia57. Of note, hyperglycaemia was seen to persist for 3 years after recovery from SARS, perhaps indicating long- term damage to pancreatic β- cells57. These data suggest that the ACE2 as part of the RAAS might be involved in the association between COVID-19 and diabetes  mellitus (fig.\xa02).', 'Classic RAAS Extended RAAS', 'Angiotensinogen', 'Renin inhibitor Renin', 'Angiotensin I-(1-10)', 'ACE inhibitor', 'ACE', 'ACE', 'ACE2', 'ACE2', 'Chymases, cathepsins', 'Angiotensin II-(1-8)', 'ARB', 'AT1 receptor AT', '2 receptor• BP elevation• Oxidative damage• Vascular dysfunction• Cardiovascular remodelling', 'Mineralocorticoid receptor blockers', 'Aldosterone• Water and sodium retention↑ Cardiac preload• BP reduction• Apoptosis• Anti-remodelling• Anti-inflammatory • Anti-oxidative', 'Protective effect on COVID-19• Anti-inflammatory• Anti-oxidative• Anti-remodelling• BP reduction• Neuroprotective', 'Mas receptor• Some ARBs• Some ACE inhibitors', 'Angiotensin-(1-9)', 'Endopeptidase ACE, neprilysin', 'Some ACE inhibitors', 'Angiotensin-(1-5)', 'Inactive fragment• Some ARBs• Some ACE inhibitors', 'Angiotensin-(1-7)', 'Fig. 2 | The role of ACE2 within the RAAS. Because angiotensin- converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is considered an important severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS- CoV-2) receptor facilitating infection of relevant cells, such as pneumocytes, it is important to understand its normal physiological function. Inhibition of ACE blocks metabolism of angiotensin-(1–7) to angiotensin-(1–5) and can lead to elevation of angiotensin-(1–7) levels in plasma and tissues258.  In animal models, angiotensin-(1–7) enhances vasodilation and inhibits vascular contractions to angiotensin II258. An ex vivo study using human internal mammary arteries showed that angiotensin-(1–7) blocks angiotensin II- induced vasoconstriction and inhibits ACE in human cardiovascular tissues258. In an ex vivo study, angiotensin-(1–7) and some ACE inhibitors, such as quinaprilat and captopril, potentiated bradykinin, resulting in blood pressure reduction by inhibiting ACE259.

Several mechanisms are thought to be responsible for an accentuated clinical severity of COVID-19 in peo-ple with diabetes mellitus (fig.\xa03). As described already, glucotoxicity, endothelial damage by inflammation, oxi-dative stress and cytokine production contribute to an increased risk of thromboembolic complications and of damage to vital organs in patients with diabetes mellitus60 (fig.\xa01). In addition, drugs often used in the clinical care of patients with COVID-19, such as systemic corticos-teroids or antiviral agents, might contribute to worsening hyperglycaemia (Table\xa02; Supplementary Table 2).', 'A multicentre retrospective study from China found that high fasting glucose levels (≥7.0 mmol/l (≥126 mg/dl))  at admission was an independent predictor of increased mortality in patients with COVID-19 who did not have diabetes mellitus61. Therefore, it is prudent to monitor glucose levels and to treat worsening hyperglycaemia in patients with progression to severe states of COVID-19.', 'Of note, a study found that therapy with the corti-costeroid dexamethasone reduced mortality in patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation by 36% (HR\xa00.64, 95% CI 0.51–0.81) and in those receiving oxygen only by 18% (HR 0.82; 95% CI 0.72–0.94)62. Whether similar benefits were observed in the 24% of participants with diabetes mellitus has not yet been reported. Glucocorticoid therapy probably reduces production of cytokines and prevents their detrimen-tal effects in patients with severe COVID-19.

Also known as CD26, dipep-tidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) is well recognized to have an important function in glucose homeostasis63. In addi-tion, DPP4 has an integral role in the immune system as a marker of activated T lymphocytes and a regulator of the expression of many chemokines, including CCL5, CXCL12, CXCL2 (also known as GRO- b) and CXCL11 (also known as I- TAC)64,65. DDP4 inhibitors (DPP4is) are commonly used to decrease blood levels of glucose and to treat T2DM.', 'Based on reports of upper respiratory tract infec-tions, concerns have been raised about an increased risk of viral infections with DPP4 inhibition66; however, evidence from clinical trials on the association between the use of DPP4is and the risk of community- acquired pneumonia in patients with T2DM does not confirm an increased risk67. Although ACE2 is recognized as the main receptor, DPP4 might also bind to SARS- CoV-2 (ref.68). Interestingly, certain polymorphisms of the DPP4 protein found in people in Africa were associated with a reduced chance of MERS- CoV infection69. However, plasma levels of DPP4 in patients with MERS- CoV were statistically significantly reduced70, suggesting a protec-tive role of DPP4. Whether DPP4is affect the function of DPP4 as a viral receptor is a matter of debate.', 'The expression of DPP4 in the spleen, lung, liver, kidney and some immune cells seems to be altered in patients with T2DM71. Furthermore, DPP4 is not just a cell membrane protein but is shed into the circulation as soluble DPP4. Of note, levels of soluble DPP4 are increased by DPP4is in mice72. Whether soluble DPP4 might have a role as a virus receptor or is protective during SARS- CoV-2 infection is entirely unclear. In an in\xa0vitro study, treatment with the DPP4is sitaglip-tin, vildagliptin or saxagliptin did not block the entry of coronaviruses into cells73. More detailed studies are needed to fully characterize the role of DPP4is in patients with COVID-19 and T2DM.', 'Interactions between DPP4 and the RAAS (includ-ing ACE2) have not been studied in detail but seem possible74,75. DPP4 and the RAAS are linked genetically and are associated with the risk of SARS- CoV-2 infec-tion and possibly severity of COVID-19, particularly in patients with diabetes mellitus76. This link is supported by the findings that DPP4 expression was increased in blood T lymphocytes from patients with T2DM and was correlated with insulin resistance77, and upregula-tion of DPP4 in diabetic animals led to dysregulation of immune responses78.', 'Therapy with DPP4is proved neutral, not supe-rior, in terms of major adverse cardiac events, includ-ing stroke, in previous DPP4i cardiovascular outcome trials in patients with T2DM79,80; however, DPP4 ', 'Drugs Mechanisms of action', 'Source of data Blood glucose Insulin sensitivity or resistanceβ- Cell function', 'IL-1β inhibitors IL-1β antagonism Human studies No effect on HbA1c in patients with recent- onset T1DM198', 'No effect on C- peptide secretion in patients with\xa0recent-\u200bonset\u200bT1DM198–', 'Patients with DM  and/or insulin resistance', 'No effect on HbA1c in patients with recent- onset T1DM198', 'No effect on C- peptide secretion in patients with\xa0recent-\u200bonset\u200bT1DM198–', 'JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitors', 'Suppressing JAK–STAT signalling, inhibition of clathrin- medicated endocytosis, immunosuppression', 'Animal studies ↓ Reversal of new- onset DM in NOD mice200↓ Insulin level233 –', 'Patients with DM  and/or insulin resistance↓ DM development200 ↓ Insulin level233 –', 'BTK inhibitor Immunomodulatory effect on macrophages, reducing the production of cytokines', 'Animal studies ↓ BG201 – –', 'TNF inhibitors TNF antagonism Human studies ↓ FBG205,234,235; ↓ HbA1c (refS230,235); ↓ patients with new- onset DM and RA and psoriasis236↓ Insulin resistance205,235,237;  ↑ insulin sensitivity205,237↑ β- Cell function205', 'Patients with DM and/or insulin resistance↓ FBG205,234,235; ↓ HbA1c (refS230,235)↓ Insulin resistance205;  ↑ insulin sensitivity205↑ β- Cell function205', 'Corticosteroids206,238 Anti- inflammatory effects', 'Human studies ↑ HbA1c; ↑ BG (mainly PPG)↑ Insulin resistance;  ↓ insulin sensitivity↓ Insulin production and secretion', 'BG, blood glucose; BTK, Bruton’s tyrosine kinase; COVID-19, coronavirus disease 19; DM, diabetes mellitus; FPG, fasting plasma glucose; GIP, glucose- dependent insulinotropic polypeptide; GLUT4, glucose transporter type 4; JAK, Janus kinase; NOD, non- obese diabetic; PPG, postprandial glucose; RA, rheumatoid arthritis; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription; T1DM, type 1 diabetes mellitus; TMPRSS2, transmembrane protease serine 2; TNF, tumour necrosis factor.', 'Table 2 (cont.) | Glycaemic effects of potential pharmacological agents for COVID-19naTure revIewS | ENDOCRINOlOGy', 'R e v i e w s  volume 17 | January 2021 | 19inhibition has been reported to have beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system, such as reducing oxida-tive stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress, because of its anti- inflammatory properties63,81. More specifically, the receptor binding domain of DPP4 interacts with adenosine deaminase (ADA) in CD4+ and CD8+ human T\xa0cells82,83. This finding indicates a possible modulation of the host’s immune system by SARS- CoV-2, through binding to DPP4 and competing for the ADA recogni-tion site. Thus, the DPP4 receptor binding domain might represent a potential strategy for treating infection by SARS- CoV-2 (ref.84).', 'Of note, a study found that systemic DPP4 inhibition with DPP4is increased circulating levels of inflammatory markers in a mouse model fed with regular chow85. By contrast, in humans, treatment with a DPP4i decreased DPP4 enzyme activity but did not increase the levels of inflammatory markers85. These findings suggest the pos-sibility of dissociation between DPP4 enzyme activity, the use of DPP4i and inflammatory markers in animals and humans. Moreover, DPP4i treatment suppressed T\xa0cell immune responses to the virus in an experiment in human peripheral blood86. One human study found that circulating levels of brain- derived neurotrophic factor were decreased by DPP4 inhibition87. Clearly, the effect of DPP4 inhibition on T\xa0cell function and T\xa0cell- mediated inflammatory and immune responses in patients with COVID-19 requires further research.', 'Current knowledge does not suggest safety issues associated with the use of DPP4is in patients with T2DM and COVID-19 (refS45,88). In a retrospective case–control study from northern Italy, sitagliptin treatment during hospitalization was associated with reduced mortal-ity and improved clinical outcomes in such patients89. Another Italian case series described the association between DPP4i treatment and a statistically signifi-cantly reduced mortality; however, this result was based on only 11 patients (of whom one died)90. However, DPP4i treatment was associated with worse outcomes (mortality results were not presented) in 27 patients with T2DM treated with DPP4is than in 49 treated with other glucose- lowering medications87. Therefore, prospective randomized clinical trials (RCTs) in diverse populations of patients with T2DM and COVID-19 are necessary to assess the potential survival benefits associated with DPP4 inhibition in patients with COVID-19, which might also extend to patients without diabetes mellitus.', 'Glucagon- like peptide 1 and its analogues. Therapy with most glucagon- like peptide 1 (GLP1) analogues in patients with T2DM reduced the rate of major adverse cardiac events in cardiovascular outcome trials79,91. GLP1 contributes to glucose homeostasis and GLP1 receptor stimulation elicits a variety of pleiotropic effects (for example, on immune function92 and inflammatory processes93). In humans, GLP1 receptors are widely distributed in various cells and organs, including the kidneys, lungs, heart, endothelial cells and nerve cells91. GLP1- based treatments reduce the production of various inflammatory cytokines and infiltration of immune cells in the liver, kidney, lung, brain and the cardiovascular system63,91,94.', 'In animal models of atherosclerosis, the GLP1 ana-logue exendin 4 substantially reduced the accumulation of monocytes and macrophages in the vascular wall and inhibited atherogenesis by regulating inflammation in macrophages95. In addition, exendin 4 exerted renopro-tective effects in animal models through inhibition of nuclear factor- κB (NF- κB) activity in the kidney, and elevated NF- κB activity is known to contribute to the crosstalk between inflammation and oxidative stress96. In\xa0vitro, liraglutide treatment reduced expression of the vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 in human aortic endothelial cells after stimulation with lipopolysac-charide or tumour necrosis factor97. In addition, lira-glutide administered to C57BL/6 mice fed a high- fat diet reduced inflammation and lipid accumulation in the\xa0heart98.', 'Infusions of native GLP1 in patients with T1DM reduced plasma levels of IL-6, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 and markers of oxidative stress99. In humans, GLP1 and GLP1 analogues have been shown to be bene-ficial for the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases, such as non- alcoholic fatty liver disease, atherosclero-sis and neurodegenerative disorders100,101 and these effects seem to be primarily mediated by a reduction in the activity of inflammatory pathways91. Whether such effects on the low- grade inflammation associated with atherosclerosis translate into anti- inflammatory effects relevant for the disease process of COVID-19 remains to be studied. However, there is little concern for the continued use of GLP1 analogues in patients with diabetes mellitus and COVID-19 based on such  properties.', 'People with CVD or kidney disease show a worse prognosis during the course of COVID-19 than those without these diseases43. Therefore, it seems to be pru-dent to preserve the integrity of the cardiorenal system in people at high risk of SARS- CoV-2 infection. Given that beneficial roles of GLP1 analogues for the prevention of CVD and kidney disease have been well established80,102, these drugs could be an ideal option for the treatment of patients with diabetes mellitus at such risk103.', 'During the COVID-19 pandemic, having overweight or obesity has several disadvantages; for example, the presence of chronic low- grade inflammation and a com-promised immune system104. People with COVID-19 and obesity showed lower lung compliance and worse health outcomes than those with COVID-19 but with-out obesity, and health- care providers have difficulties in finding the right mask size and problems with mask ventilation104. Therefore, GLP1 analogues can be recom-mended for patients with obesity and T2DM because they have weight- reducing properties105. However, ini-tiating or maintaining such therapies in acute or critical situations (such as severe COVID-19) is not recom-mended because they will take time to become effective, due to slow up- titration, and might provoke nausea and vomiting106.', 'Sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors. Sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors (SGLT2is) act on the kidney to reduce blood levels of glucose and are used to treat T2DM.

However, SGLT2i treatment can cause ketoacidosis109, especially in critically ill patients. Importantly, SGLT2is have profound effects on urinary glucose and sodium excretion, resulting in osmotic diuresis and potentially dehydration109, and increased urinary uric acid excretion, which has been suggested to be a risk factor for acute kidney injury through both urate crystal- dependent and crystal- independent mechanisms110. As such, the use of SGLT2is might be difficult in patients under critical care, who need metic-ulous control of their fluid balance. In addition, these drugs must be discontinued in the face of a reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate, which limits their glucose- lowering effects substantially, and will be a typical risk in critically ill patients. Nonetheless, an international study is ongoing to evaluate the effect of dapagliflozin versus placebo, given once daily for 30\xa0days, in reducing disease progression, complications and all- cause mortality in all patients admitted with COVID-19 (NCT04350593). The result of this study might help reveal the implications of the use of SGLT2is in such patients.', 'Thiazolidinedione. The thiazolidinediones are agonists of the peroxisome proliferator- activated receptor- γ (PPARγ), a nuclear receptor that regulates the tran-scription of various genes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism111. In many basic and animal studies, thiazolidinediones have been found to reduce insu-lin resistance and to have putative anti- inflammatory and antioxidant effects, contributing to their anti- atherosclerotic properties112,113. Given these properties, thiazolidinediones have the potential to mediate protec-tive effects on the cardiovascular system. In a review of RCTs that compared thiazolidinediones with placebo for the secondary prevention of stroke and related vascular events in people who had experienced stroke or transient ischaemic attack, thiazolidinedione treatment reduced the recurrence of stroke compared with placebo114. However, thiazolidinedione therapy was associated with weight gain and oedema and more importantly was asso-ciated with aggravation of heart failure115. These results do not support the use of thiazolidinedione in patients with COVID-19. More clinical trials are needed to opti-mize the risk–benefit ratio of using thiazolidinediones in patients with COVID-19.', 'Use of antidiabetic medicationsBased on the data from previous basic and clinical studies and the most recent information available from current publications, we propose some guidelines for the use of glucose- lowering medications in patients with T2DM and COVID-19, according to the clinical status of COVID-19, which is based on the WHO clin-ical progression scale116 (fig.\xa04; Supplementary Table 3). Few published recommendations exist for the use of these medications during the COVID-19 pandemic16. In patients with COVID-19, we should be prepared for acute hyperglycaemia (that might be exacerbated by inflammation- associated insulin resistance), and we face the need to provide appropriate glycaemic control effec-tively and rapidly. The choice of agents should be guided mainly by their presumed effectiveness and by poten-tial or actual adverse effects. In line with the review by Drucker16, we recommend DPP4is and GLP1 analogues in patients with mild to moderate symptoms because these agents have proven glucose- lowering efficacy in hospital settings, as well as in outpatient clinics. However, insufficient data are available to support the use of these agents instead of insulin in critically ill patients with T2DM and COVID-19, especially if the therapy needs to be initiated under conditions of severe illness (fig.\xa04; Supplementary Table\xa03). The anti- inflammatory actions of DPP4is and GLP1 analogues suggest the need for clin-ical trials with such agents in patients with T2DM and COVID-19.', 'In line with Drucker’s recommendation16, we sug-gest using mainly insulin for critically ill patients with diabetes mellitus infected with SARS- CoV-2. Optimal glucose control using insulin infusion statistically significantly reduced IL-6 and D- dimer levels and improved severity in patients with COVID-19 with or without diabetes mellitus117. Metformin has shown anti- inflammatory actions in preclinical studies, and furthermore metformin treatment reduced the circu-lating levels of inflammation biomarkers in people with T2DM118. In a study that compared the outcomes in hospitalized Chinese patients with COVID-19 and dia-betes mellitus (mean age 64 years, 53% men) between 104 patients receiving metformin and 179 patients not receiving metformin, in- hospital mortality was signif-icantly lower in the those receiving metformin (2.9% versus 12.3%; P = 0.01)119; however, this finding might have been driven by selection bias, as patients with severe respiratory problems cannot be treated with met-formin. Therefore, physicians should be conservative in their prescription of glucose- lowering medications, with the above considerations in mind, because there is little evidence proving superiority in the efficacy and safety of any specific medication in patients with diabetes mellitus and COVID-19.', 'Specific recommendations for the treatment of ketoacidosis in patients with COVID-19 have been published120, with an emphasis on subcutaneous insu-lin regimens. Frequent blood glucose and ketone body monitoring is mandatory in patients with COVID-19 and hyperglycaemia. Fluid and electrolyte management in patients with COVID-19 and impaired respiratory function should follow general recommendations121,122; no specific guidance exists for fluid and electrolyte management in patients with diabetes mellitus and COVID-19.', 'COVID-19 and T1DMSo far, information regarding the effect of diabetes mel-litus on COVID-19 often has not differentiated between the major types123 and is mostly related to T2DM owing to the high prevalence of this form of diabetes mellitus11,19. Some important information is available specifically for T1DM, as discussed in this section.naTure revIewS | ENDOCRINOlOGy', 'R e v i e w s  volume 17 | January 2021 | 21', 'Newly diagnosed T1DM. Case reports have described patients with newly diagnosed T1DM with ketoacido-sis occurring at the onset of COVID-19 (ref.124), and patients with newly diagnosed T1DM without ketoac-idosis in whom ketoacidosis occurred several weeks after apparent recovery from COVID-19 (ref.125). These findings raise the question as to whether SARS- CoV-2 can trigger this metabolic disease. One series found 29\xa0patients who were not known to have diabetes mel-litus who developed hyperglycaemia during treatment for COVID-19, some of whom had a normal HbA1c level on admission126. However, fewer paediatric patients with T1DM than expected were admitted to special-ized Italian diabetes centres127. By contrast, specialized hospitals in northwest London, UK, saw more patients presenting with severe ketoacidosis than expected, sug-gesting a potential increase in numbers of patients with new- onset T1DM128. These contradictory findings might be explained by the small patient numbers analysed: they could have been down to chance, or they could be caused by changes in the availability of medical services during the COVID-19 pandemic. A population- based study from Germany found no deviation from the projected numbers of newly diagnosed paediatric patients with T1DM129. However, the same study found a statistically significant increase in diabetic ketoacidosis and severe ketoacidosis in children and adolescents presenting with new- onset T1DM130. A probable explanation is that this finding reflects patients trying to delay hospital admis-sion because of their fear of acquiring SARS- CoV-2 infection. As the COVID-19 pandemic progresses and larger numbers of patients are studied, it will become more apparent if a true link exists between COVID-19 and new- onset T1DM.', 'Metabolic control of outpatients with T1DM.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity is based on the WHO clinical progression scale116. Insulin is mainly recommended for critically ill patients with diabetes mellitus infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS- CoV-2). Optimal glucose control using insulin infusion statistically significantly reduced inflammatory cytokines and improved severity of COVID-19 (ref.117). Metformin can be used for uninfected patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) or ambulatory patients with mild COVID-19. However, it should be noted that metformin is not encouraged for use in critically ill patients. Sulfonylurea can be used in uninfected patients with T2DM, but it is not recommended in patients with severe COVID-19 because it can provoke hypoglycaemia. Thiazolidinediones have the potential to mediate protective effects on the cardiovascular system114. However, thiazolidinedione therapy induces weight gain and oedema and tends to aggravate heart failure115. These results do not support its use in patients with severe COVID-19. Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitors are one of the most frequently prescribed medications without serious adverse events. DPP4 inhibitor therapy has proved neutral in terms of major adverse cardiac events in previous cardiovascular outcome trials79,80. Therefore, DPP4 inhibitors can be recommended for use in most patients with a broad spectrum of severity of COVID-19. Given that beneficial roles of glucagon- like peptide 1 (GLP1) analogues for the prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and kidney disease are well established80,102, these drugs could be an ideal option for the treatment of patients with T2DM at risk of CVD and kidney disease103. Sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor treatment induces osmotic diuresis and potentially dehydration109, which has been suggested to be a risk factor for acute kidney injury and ketoacidosis110. As such, the use of SGLT2 inhibitors is not recommended in patients under critical care.

During lockdown, self- reported phys-ical activity was found to be reduced133,134 and more con-sistent patterns of nutrient intake and sleep were found133; these findings might reflect conditions under which gly-caemic control is easier to achieve. This effect might differ from the situation in developing countries with reduced access to food, medications, blood glucose test strips and medical services135,136. The COVID-19 pandemic has also offered opportunities for remote consultation and telemedicine, which might contribute to the glycaemic control patterns seen in developed countries137,138.', 'Hospitalized patients with T1DM and COVID-19. A population- based analysis from Belgium showed a sim-ilar risk of hospitalization in people with T1DM than in  normoglycaemic individuals (0.21% versus 0.17%)139. In this study and another from the USA, hospitalized patients with T1DM being treated for COVID-19 had metabolic characteristics similar to patients with T1DM who were hospitalized owing to other diagnoses, and the levels of HbA1c were not higher in the patients with COVID-19 (refS139,140). However, plasma concentra-tions of glucose were higher at the time of admission in patients with T1DM and COVID-19 than in patients without non- COVID-19 diagnoses, indicating some acute deterioration in glycaemic control139. Worse out-comes in patients with T1DM and COVID-19 (defined as tracheal intubation or death up to day 7 of hospi-tal treatment) seemed to be confined to patients aged ≥75\xa0years141.', 'T1DM and COVID-19 outcomes.

Patients with T1DM at particular risk were older, had increased HbA1c levels, arterial hyperten-sion, renal functional impairment and previous cardio-vascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke or heart failure)11,19. These data support the association between T1DM and poor COVID-19 outcomes.', 'RAAS inhibitors and statinsThere have been relevant debates regarding benefits or harms related to the use of ACE inhibitors or angioten-sin receptor blockers during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to classic RAAS, alternative components, including ACE2, angiotensin-(1–7), angiotensin-(1–9) and the Mas receptor, might be involved in the entry and progression of SARS- CoV-2 (fig.\xa02). Many international medical societies recommend continuing RAAS inhib-itors because there is no proven harm in using them in the context of diabetes mellitus and COVID-19.', 'The anti- inflammatory and immune- modulatory effects of 3- hydroxy-3- methyl- glutaryl- CoA reductase inhibitors, or statins, suggest that they might be benefi-cial for treating influenza and bacterial infections142,143. A study from China found that statin use was associated with a lower risk of all- cause mortality and a favourable recovery profile in hospitalized patients with COVID-19  (ref.144). However, the benefit associated with statin ther-apy needs to be validated in RCTs. More information about the RAAS system, including ACE2 and statins, is presented in the Supplementary Box.', 'Thromboembolic eventsEvidence suggests that COVID-19 considerably increases the likelihood of thromboembolic events, which represent a predominant cause of death6,145,146. The first evidence of abnormal coagulation parameters associated with COVID-19 appeared in early reports from China. For example, the baseline characteristics of the first 99 patients hospitalized in Wuhan found that 6% had an elevated activated partial thromboplas-tin time, 5% showed elevated prothrombin and 36% had elevated D- dimer6. Another study from China found that patients who died from COVID-19 had statistically significantly increased levels of D- dimer and fibrin degradation products60. In this study that included middle- aged Chinese patients with COVID-19,  more than 71% of those who died fulfilled the crite-ria for disseminated intravascular coagulation, but only 0.6% of the survivors belonged in this category60. Of note, 11 studies thus far have found high rates of venous thromboembolism in patients diagnosed with  COVID-19 (ref.147).', 'COVID-19- associated coagulopathy ranges from mild alterations in laboratory test outcomes to dis-seminated intravascular coagulation with a predom-inant pheno type of thrombotic and/or multiple organ failure148. The profound inflammatory response to SARS- CoV-2 infection leads to the development of coagulation abnormalities146. Vascular endothelial dys-function seems to contribute to the pathophysiology of microcirculatory changes in patients with SARS- CoV-2 infection149. Importantly, SARS- CoV-2 can enter and infect endothelial cells via the ACE2 receptor150, with viral replication causing inflammatory cell infiltration, endothelial cell apoptosis and microvascular prothrom-botic effects151. Post- mortem examinations of patients who died with SARS- CoV-2 infection have demon-strated viral inclusions within endothelial cells and sequestered mononuclear and polymorphonuclear cellu-lar infiltration, with evidence of endothelial apoptosis151. Thus, evidence suggests that an increased release of coag-ulation factors and dysregulation and destruction of the endothelial cells are the main mechanisms of the increase in thromboembolism in patients with COVID-19  (ref.148). Endothelial dysfunction might also explain reports of cerebrovascular complications in younger patients, and in patients with myocardial ischaemia  and/or thromboembolic complications151,152.', 'Thromboembolic risk in patients with diabetes melli-tus. Several publications have reported an increased thromboembolic risk among patients with diabetes mellitus outside the specific situation of SARS- CoV-2 infection. For example, a population- based study found that patients with T2DM exhibited an increased risk of venous thromboembolism compared with controls (HR 1.44, 95% CI 1.27–1.63)153. Furthermore, the risks of pulmonary embolism were greater in the patients with T2DM than in the controls (HR 1.52, 95% CI 1.22–1.90)153. Another study found that the incidence ', 'Disseminated intravascular coagulationa condition that causes abnormal blood clotting throughout the body’s small blood vessels.naTure revIewS | ENDOCRINOlOGy', 'R e v i e w s  volume 17 | January 2021 | 23of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) after total knee replace-ment was statistically significantly higher in patients with diabetes mellitus than in those without154. Diabetes mellitus was also found to be associated with an increase of more than twofold in the risk of ulcer formation after DVT155. Thus, patients with diabetes mellitus are already in a high- risk category for a thromboembolic event  or stroke156,157.', 'To prevent such complications, patients with diabetes mellitus who are at risk of SARS- CoV-2 infection should try not to be sedentary for long periods, as regular phys-ical activity is associated with decreased incidence of thromboembolism158. Instead, these individuals should try to engage in physical activity to improve blood cir-culation. Appropriate simple exercises for performance at home (ankle rotations and calf massage) are available and effective159 and should be recommended. Patients who experience pain in their legs, shortness of breath or chest pain must not hesitate to contact their physician owing to suspected thromboembolic complications.', 'Considering an increased thromboembolic risk among patients with diabetes mellitus153–157, we propose that physicians should consider prescribing antiplatelet or anticoagulating agents more actively in patients with diabetes mellitus to prevent thromboembolic events and their complications during the COVID-19 pandemic.', 'The precise molecular and cellular mechanisms behind the higher coagulability of blood among patients with COVID-19 is currently poorly understood and conventional prophylaxis does not seem to be always effective in the prevention of thromboembolism160. However, anticoagulant therapy (low molecular weight heparin) produced better prognoses in patients with severe COVID-19 at high thromboembolic risk, such as those with elevated D- dimer levels161. Therefore, it might be prudent to start anticoagulant therapy in hospital-ized patients with moderate to severe COVID-19, even though it might not be necessary in patients with a mild course of the disease.', 'Although the evidence supporting any direct effects of GLP1 analogues on the risk of thromboembolism is limited, several animal studies have found that treat-ment with GLP1 analogues inhibits atheroma forma-tion and stabilizes plaques in carotid arteries and aortic arches100,162. Administration of GLP1 in\xa0vitro decreased the expression of matrix metalloproteinases 2 and MCP1 and the translocation of NF- κB–p65, which are linked to a high risk of thromboembolism100. A cardiovascu-lar outcome study found that therapy with dulaglutide, a long- acting GLP1 analogue, decreased the incidence of stroke in patients with T2DM163. Taken together, it would be beneficial in patients with diabetes mellitus to choose antidiabetic agents that might be able to decrease the risk of thromboembolic events.', 'Potential drug interactions. Potential interactions might occur between investigational drugs for COVID-19 and commonly administered oral anticoagulants or anti-platelet agents. A combination agent of lopinavir and ritonavir, two protease inhibitors, is used empirically for treating patients with COVID-19 in some coun-tries, including China and India164,165. These protease inhibitors inhibit cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) enzyme metabolism, resulting in reduced levels of the active metabolite of the antiplatelet agent clopidogrel. By contrast, these protease inhibitors might increase the antiplatelet effects of ticagrelor by inhibiting its metabolism166. The anticoagulant vitamin K antagonists, such apixaban and betrixaban, require dose adjustment, which could be adversely affected by interactions with protease inhibitors. By contrast, the anticoagulant effects of edoxaban and rivaroxaban, non- vitamin K antago-nist oral anticoagulants, can be increased substantially by lopinavir and ritonavir, discouraging concomitant administration with these drugs167. Therefore, care should be taken in prescribing drugs that might affect the activity of CYP3A4 because they might affect the effects of antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants that are metabolized through the CYP3A4 system168. Remdesivir is a nucleotide analogue inhibitor of RNA- dependent RNA polymerase and has shown beneficial effects in shortening the time to recovery in adults hospitalized with COVID-19 in a preliminary study169. Remdesivir was found to have no significant interactions with antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants166,168. In general, no major drug–drug interactions are known to occur between investigational COVID-19 therapies and parenteral anticoagulants.', 'Taken together, it is reasonable to assess the risk of thromboembolism and to consider pharmacological thromboprophylaxis in patients with diabetes mellitus, especially if they have other thromboembolic risk factors or they are hospitalized with COVID-19 (ref.147).', 'COVID-19 treatments and metabolismThe global pandemic of COVID-19 has accelerated\xa0the race to find effective prevention and treatment for SARS- CoV-2 infection170. Currently, more than 1,800 clin-ical trials targeting viral entry and replication and immune responses to infection are ongoing; however, the efficacy of most drugs has not yet been proven (ClinicalTrials.gov database of COVID-19 interventional studies). Candidates for COVID-19 therapy can affect glucose metabolism pharmacologically or through the modula-tion of inflammation and the immune system (Table\xa02; Supplementary Table 2). Thus, these drugs require  particular consideration in patients with diabetes mellitus.', 'Antiviral therapies. Camostat mesylate is a serine pro-tease inhibitor being investigated for its ability to inhibit viral entry, as it inhibits transmembrane protease ser-ine\xa02 (TMPRSS2), which facilitates viral entry into the host cell171. It was reported that camostat mesylate treatment reduced the incidence of new- onset diabetes mellitus in patients with chronic pancreatitis172. This drug improved glycaemia and insulin resistance and decreased lipid accumulation in animal models173,174. The antimalaria drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have been used to treat SARS- CoV-2 infection despite their potential adverse effects175,176. The two main mecha-nisms of action of hydroxychloroquine are believed to be via its restriction of viral spike protein cleavage at the ACE2 binding site, and its anti- inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties177. Hydroxychloroquine www.nature.com/nrendo', 'R e v i e w s', '24 | January 2021 | volume 17 https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?type=Intr&cond=Covid-19https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?type=Intr&cond=Covid-19also has glucose- lowering efficacy by increasing insulin sensitivity and improving pancreatic β- cell function178, which has enabled hydroxychloroquine to be prescribed as an antidiabetic medication in some countries179. Therefore, adjustment of pre- existing antidiabetic drugs might be needed to avoid hypoglycaemia in uncommon cases of patients with diabetes mellitus who are taking hydroxychloroquine180–182. Of note, studies have shown conflicting results in the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 (refS183,184). More well- designed studies are urgently needed to evaluate its therapeutic efficacy.', 'Protease inhibitors such as lopinavir and ritona-vir have been reported to increase the risk of hyperglycaemia185,186 and new- onset diabetes mellitus187, to exacerbate pre- existing diabetes mellitus and occasionally to induce the development of diabetic ketoacidosis188. In patients with HIV infection, these drugs reduced insulin sensitivity and β- cell function by up to 50%185. Another issue with protease inhibitors is pharmacological interactions with co- administered glucose- lowering drugs. For example, ritonavir acts as an inhibitor of CYP3A4/5 (ref.189), increasing plasma con-centrations of the DPP4i saxagliptin, and as an inducer of uridine 5′- diphospho- glucuronosyltransferase190, decreasing concentrations of the SGLT2i canagliflozin. Therefore, frequent blood glucose monitoring and dos-ing adjustments are recommended for patients treated with these drug combinations. Remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue inhibitor of RNA- dependent RNA polymer-ase, improved hyperglycaemia, insulin resistance, fatty liver and endotoxaemia in mice fed a high- fat diet191. By contrast, increases in blood levels of glucose were simi-lar between the remdesivir- treated and placebo- treated groups in two RCTs with multiethnic groups169 and Chinese patients192. Thus, additional evidence is needed to elucidate its effect on glucose metabolism.', 'Adjunctive therapies. Adjunctive therapies are used to prevent the progression of COVID-19 to more severe forms, such as ARDS and multi- organ failure during the hyperinflammatory phase. However, these drugs can also influence glucose metabolism. For example, IL-6 receptor inhibitors, a possible therapeutic option in patients severely ill with COVID-19 who have extensive lung lesions and high IL-6 levels193, had beneficial effects on glucose intolerance and insulin resistance in patients with rheumatoid arthritis194. Furthermore, anakinra, an IL-1β inhibitor that significantly improved respiratory function in patients with severe COVID-19 (ref.195), improved glycaemia and β- cell function in patients with T2DM196. By contrast, canakinumab, another IL-1β inhibitor that is under investigation in a clinical trial for the treatment of COVID-19 (ref.197), was not effective in the treatment of recent- onset T1DM198. In animal studies, Janus kinase 1/2 inhibitors and Bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitors, other investigational agents for COVID-19 treatment199, improved glycaemia200,201 and insulitis200 and impaired the levels of anti- insulin  B lymphocytes202 and insulin antibodies203, which might have protective roles in T1DM. TNF inhibitors, particu-larly adalimumab, are promising therapeutic options for mitigating the inflammatory stage in COVID-19 (ref.204). The use of TNF inhibitors improved hyperglycaemia, insulin resistance and β- cell function in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis205.', 'Systemic corticosteroids are well known to induce hyperglycaemia, primarily by increasing postpran-dial levels of glucose, insulin resistance and pancreatic β- cell dysfunction206, that often necessitates the initia-tion of insulin therapy. Contrary to this concern, intra-venous dexamethasone therapy statistically significantly increased the number of ventilator- free days among patients with severe ARDS and COVID-19 (refS62,207). Furthermore, a meta- analysis of clinical trials showed that systemic corticosteroid therapy is associated with reduced short- term all- cause mortality in patients with severe COVID-19 (ref.208). Hydrocortisone treat-ment in different regimens also showed a tendency to produce a better hospital course in these patients209. However, another study failed to prove any beneficial effect of low- dose hydrocortisone in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 (ref.210). The less than opti-mal dose might be a reason for these disappointing results. Further investigation is required to elucidate the effects of pharmacological treatments for COVID-19 on glucose metabolism in patients with diabetes mellitus.', 'ConclusionsDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, patients with diabetes mellitus should be aware that COVID-19 can increase blood levels of glucose and, as such, they should follow clinical guidelines for the management of diabetes mel-litus more strictly, as described here. We provide the following general guidance for patients and health- care providers: patients should be extra vigilant regarding their adherence to prescribed medications (including insulin injections) and their blood levels of glucose, which should be checked more frequently than previ-ously. If blood concentrations of glucose are consistently higher than usual, patients should consult their physi-cian. In the light of current global quarantine policies, more emphasis needs to be placed by health- care pro-viders on healthy food intake and physical activity in patients with diabetes mellitus. If patients experience symptoms such as a dry cough, excessive sputum pro-duction or fever, or show a sudden rise in glucose level, they should be advised to consult their physician imme-diately. Furthermore, it is strongly recommended that patients should strictly adhere to the recommendations of their doctor and be wary of messages communicated by various types of media (including the internet), which often might not stand scientific scrutiny. Most impor-tantly, general precautions should be strictly followed by both health- care providers and their patients, such as social distancing, wearing a mask, washing hands and using disinfectants, to reduce the risk of infection in patients with diabetes mellitus. Telehealth or remote consultations might help reduce the risk posed by direct physical contact between patients and medical personnel. These could be further ways to minimize the risk of SARS- CoV-2 transmission and at the same time provide continued and safe medical care to the general\xa0public.naTure revIewS | ENDOCRINOlOGy', 'R e v i e w s  volume 17 | January 2021 | 25', 'Coronavirus infections are proven to have a huge effect on the management of diabetes mellitus because they aggravate inflammation and alter immune system responses, leading to difficulties in glycaemic control. SARS- CoV-2 infection also increases the risk of throm-boembolism and is more likely to induce cardiorespi-ratory failure in patients with diabetes mellitus than in patients without diabetes mellitus. All of these mecha-nisms are now believed to contribute to the poor prog-nosis of patients with diabetes mellitus and COVID-19. During the COVID-19 pandemic, tight glycaemic control and management of cardiovascular risk factors are cru-cial for patients with diabetes mellitus. Medications used for both diabetes mellitus and CVD should be adjusted accordingly for people at high risk of SARS- CoV-2 infection. Two experimental agents (dexamethasone and hydroxychloroquine) have shown some promise as treatment agents62,183,207. Based on these results, com-bined treatment with these two agents might be more beneficial than either agent alone. However, it should be kept in mind that the efficacy of dexamethasone in treat-ing COVID-19 was proven in well- designed RCTs such as the RECOVERY study62, whereas no such compelling RCTs have been performed for hydroxychloroquine.', 'In conclusion, the COVID-19 global pandemic poses considerable health hazards, especially for patients with diabetes mellitus. A definitive treatment or vaccine for COVID-19 has yet to be discovered. Therefore, pre-venting infection in the first place is still the best solu-tion. Under these circumstances, patients with diabetes mellitus should make a determined effort to maintain a healthy lifestyle and to decrease potential risk factors. The optimal management strategy for such patients, such as the choice of glucose- lowering, antihypertensive and lipid- lowering medications, is an important topic for current and future research.', 'Published online 13 November 2020', '1.

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the most common comorbidities in patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19).We aim to summarize the clinical features of DM patients with COVID-19 and find out potential factors associated with severedisease. Methods. In this retrospective, single-center study, the medical records of patients with COVID-19 in Changsha, Hunan,China, from January 21, 2020, to February 19, 2020, were reviewed. Epidemiological information, clinical features, andoutcomes were compared between DM patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) or not. Results. A total of 241 patientsconfirmed with COVID-19 were enrolled, including 19 DM patients. There were more patients in DM group admitted to theICU than non-DM group (36.8% vs. 15.8%, P = 0:045). Compared with non-DM group in the ICU, there were more femalepatients from DM group in the ICU (85.7% vs. 31.4%, P = 0:024). On admission, the mean level of glycated hemoglobin A1c(HbA1c) was higher in the ICU DM patients than that in the non-ICU DM patients (8.5% vs. 7.1%). There were more DMpatients with proteinuria in the ICU group than the non-ICU group (57.1% vs. 33.3%). Twelve DM patients (63.2%) changeddiabetic therapy during hospitalization, and all DM patients admitted to the ICU used insulin. As of March 14, all 19 DMpatients have been discharged, and no death occurred. Conclusions. DM patients with COVID-19 are vulnerable to severedisease, especially for female patients. High levels of HbA1c and proteinuria could be potential risk factors for severe COVID-19in DM patients. In addition to timely systemic therapy, the control of blood glucose and proper diabetic therapy is essential toimprove the prognosis of severe DM patients with COVID-19.', '1. Introduction', 'Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel coronavirus that has typical features ofthe coronavirus family and is highly pathogenic to humans[1]. The large-scale transmission of SARS-CoV-2 sinceDecember 2019 from Wuhan, China, has resulted in overtwenty million cases with infections and nine hundred thou-sand deaths worldwide [2]. World Health Organization(WHO) named the related disease as coronavirus disease2019 (COVID-19) and assessed the COVID-19 outbreak asa global pandemic [3]. COVID-19 has drawn intensive atten-tion and poses a threat to global public health. Diabetes mel-litus (DM) is one of the most frequent comorbidities inpatients with COVID-19 and is related to serious outcomesincluding intensive care unit (ICU) admission, invasive ven-tilation, and death [4, 5]. However, few clinical studies focus-ing on DM patients with COVID-19 have been reported, andassociated factors with severe COVID-19 in DM patientswere not clear yet.', 'In this retrospective study, we aimed to summarize andanalyze the clinical features of DM patients with COVID-19 in Changsha, Hunan Province, China, from January 21,2020, to February 19, 2020.

Based on the New Coronavirus PneumoniaPrevention and Control Program (version six) from theNational Health Commission of China, COVID-19 patientswere divided into mild patients, moderate patients, severepatients, and critical patients. Mild COVID-19 was definedas mild clinical symptoms without imaging findings ofpneumonia. Moderate COVID-19 was defined as fever andrespiratory symptoms with imaging findings of pneumonia.Severe COVID-19 was defined as any one of the followingcriteria: (1) respiratory distress with a respiratory rate ≥30 breaths/min, (2) pulse oximeter oxygen saturation ðSpO2Þ≤ 93% in the resting state, and (3) PaO2/FiO2 ≤ 300mmHg(1mmHg = 0:133 kPa). And critical COVID-19 was definedas any one of the following criteria: (1) respiratory failure inneed of mechanical ventilation, (2) shock, and (3) with otherorgan failures.

Three patients were diagnosed withDM for the first time.', 'In our study, the rate of severe COVID-19 (36.8%) in DMpatients is relatively higher than non-DM patients and higherthan that in the general population with rates of 16.0-32.0%[4–6]. The susceptibility of severe disease in DM patientsmay be attributed to several mechanisms. First, hyperglyce-mia could increase glucose concentrations in airway secre-tion and may lead to an elevated viral replication [7].Second, DM patients usually present with suppressedimmune response, such as the low levels of alexin C3 andalexin C4, which may reduce the capability of viral clearanceand increase the risk of severe disease [8, 9]. Besides that, thealtered glucose metabolism and oxidative stress could reducethe phagocytic activity of neutrophils and macrophages,impair T cell-mediated immunity, and decrease the secretionof cytokines, which impede the recognition and clearance ofinfected cells [10]. Moreover, a study indicated that SARS-CoV-2 could directly bind to ACE2 receptor of cells withhigh affinity [11], and the expression of ACE2 may beincreased in DM patients treated with ACEI, ARB, and thia-zolidinediones, which may be associated with increased riskof developing severe and fatal COVID-19 [12]. However, inour series, there were only two patients used ACEI or ARBbefore admission, and no patients used thiazolidinediones,and the relationship between ACE2 and severe COVID-19in DM patients needs further clinical confirmation.', 'Notably, the proportion of female patients was muchhigher in the DM patients admitted to the ICU, which is dif-ferent from the general population with COVID-19 as previ-ous studies found more males in severe patients withCOVID-19 [5, 6]. In our series, female DM patients wereolder, had more comorbidities, and had a longer durationof DM disease. In addition, more female patients showedproteinuria, which suggested diabetic nephropathy. All theabove may be associated with severe COVID-19, as studiesindicated older age and comorbidities are risk factors forpoor outcomes of COVID-19 [4, 13]. A large systemic reviewindicated female patients with DMmight be more vulnerableto CHD partly due to the low level of testosterone [14].Besides that, female DM patients showed more comorbiditiesincluding nephropathy, CHD, stroke, depression, and anxi-ety than male DM patients, which may be associated withpsychosocial factors, genetic predisposition, and sex hor-mones [15]. Whether similar factors influence the severityof COVID-19 in DM patients needs investigation, and thefemale preference in DM patients with severe COVID-19 stillrequires further confirmation because of the limited samplesize in our study.', 'In terms of laboratory results on admission, DM patientsin the ICU group had more lymphopenia, increased BUN, aD − dimer > 1μg/ml, higher levels of CRP, and elevatedLDH compared with DM patients in the non-ICU group.Theses laboratory abnormalities between severe and nonse-vere patients with DM were in accordance with features ingeneral population with COVID-19, as studies showed severeCOVID-19 patients usually presented with more decreasedlymphocyte counts, increased inflammatory factors, elevated', 'Table 3: Treatment and outcomes of DM patients with COVID-19.', 'Total (n = 19) ICU (n = 7) Non-ICU (n = 12)Complications 7 (36.8%) 4 (57.1%) 3 (25.0%)', 'Acute cardiac injury 1 (5.3%) 1 (14.3%) 0', 'Acute liver injury 5 (26.3%) 2 (28.6%) 3 (25.0%)', 'Allergic eruption 1 (5.3%) 1 (14.3%) 0', 'Treatment', 'Antivirals 18 (94.7%) 7 (100.0%) 11 (91.7%)', 'Antibiotics 6 (31.6%) 6 (85.7%) 0', 'Corticosteroid 7 (36.8%) 6 (85.7%) 1 (8.3%)', 'Immunoglobulin 6 (31.6%) 6 (85.7%) 0', 'Insulin 8 (42.1%) 7 (100.0%) 1 (8.3%)', 'Oxygen support', 'Nasal cannula 14 (73.7%) 4 (57.1%) 10 (83.3%)', 'High-flow nasal cannula 3 (15.85) 3 (42.9%) 0', 'Time from symptoms onset to negative RT-PCR result, days 22.6 (8-50) 30.6 (19-50) 17.9 (8-31)', 'Data are presented as mean (range) or n (%). Abbreviations: DM: diabetes mellitus; RT-PCR: reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.', '5Journal of Diabetes Research', 'D-dimer, and higher levels of myocardial zymogram [16, 17].Interestingly, DM patients admitted to the ICU had higherlevels of HbA1c than non-ICU patients in our study, whilethe average DM duration was similar in two groups. Usually,HbA1c testing takes an important role in the management ofDM, which represents the control of blood glucose over thepast 2-3 months [18]. The higher levels of HbA1c in severepatients from our series indicated that poor glycemic controlin DM patients could lead to a severe COVID-19, which alsosuggested that hyperglycemia may play a vital role in pooroutcomes of DM patients with COVID-19. Moreover, inthe current study, three patients were diagnosed with DMfor the first time mainly based on their results of HbA1c,because hyperglycemia may be caused by stress, infection,and the use of corticosteroids [19–21]. Thus, we think it isbeneficial to take a HbA1c test for DM patients withCOVID-19 on admission or patients with abnormal bloodglucose to assess the risk for severe disease. In addition toHbA1c, there were more DM patients with proteinuria inthe ICU group, which indicates that the nephropathy maybe associated with severe COVID-19. But we could not iden-tify that the proteinuria in our case series were signs of DMnephropathy as most of these patients had hypertensionmeanwhile. In all, the examination of urinalysis is alsoimportant for DM patients with COVID-19.', 'Though the high proportion of severe patients in ourseries, no death occurred and all of them had been dis-charged. The good outcomes of these DM patients withCOVID-19 may be attributed to timely combined interven-tions including the use of antivirals, antibiotics, corticoste-roids, intravenous immunoglobulin, and oxygen support.At present, no drug has been proved to be specific forSARS-CoV-2 infection, and systemic therapy is recom-mended by the National Health Commission of China andWHO [22, 23]. Moreover, it is essential to monitor and con-trol the blood glucose for DM patients with COVID-19. Inour case series, more than half of the patients changed dia-betic therapy during hospitalization, and all patients admit-ted to the ICU received insulin. The regulation of diabetictherapy was under the guidance of endocrinologists. Accord-ing to the guidelines from Chinese Diabetes Society [24] andfront-line physicians in China [25], the goals for bloodglucose control are less stringent in COVID-19 patientsadmitted to the ICU: a fasting blood glucose of 7.8-10.0mmol/l and a 2-hour postprandial of 7.8-13.9mmol/lshould be achieved. While notably, DM patients admittedto the ICU had much longer time from symptoms onset toa negative RT-PCR result of SARS-CoV-2, which indicatesthe viral clearance in severe COVID-19 patients with DMneeds more time.', 'This study has several limitations. First, our study is sin-gle center and the number of DM patients was really limited.Involving multicenter or more patients may better investigatethe clinical features of DM patients with COVID-19 and con-firm the risk factors of severe disease. Second, most patientswere not checked for diabetic complications, such as diabeticretinopathy, neuropathy, and angiopathy. Further studiesmay be needed to find out the relationship between diabeticcomplications and the severity of COVID-19.', '5. Conclusions', 'In conclusion, DM patients with COVID-19 are vulnerableto severe disease, especially female patients. High levels ofHbA1c and proteinuria could be potential risk factors forsevere COVID-19 in DM patients.

People with diabetes and related comorbidities are at increased risk of its complications and of COVID-19-relateddeath. Older age, multi-morbidity, hyperglycaemia, cardiac injury and severe inflammatory response are predictors of pooroutcome. The complex interplay between COVID-19, diabetes and the effects of related therapies is being explored. Mostpatients experience a mild illness with COVID-19, while people with diabetes are at increased risk of severe disease.Optimising glycaemic control and adopting measures to prevent disease spread are critical aspects. The management of milddisease is supportive, while very many immunomodulatory and antiviral therapies are being investigated for the treatment ofsevere disease. Several of these agents have specific considerations for use in people with diabetes. Since mass populationlockdowns are considered a key step in controlling disease spread, it follows that, in addition to the direct vulnerability to severeCOVID-19, people with diabetes can be affected by limited access to healthcare, insulin, other medications and blood glucosemonitoring equipment. Measures to prevent disease spread at the individual and community level are the key to mitigating therapidly escalating pandemic, while agents for chemoprophylaxis and vaccines are being explored. People with diabetes should berecognised as a vulnerable group for complicated disease and are at risk during times of disturbed social systems. Strategies areneeded to safeguard the health of patients with diabetes during the pandemic.

The USA and certain regions of Europe arecurrently experiencing the highest disease burden while it isapparently coming under control in China [2].', 'COVID-19 is highly transmissible from person to personthrough respiratory secretions. The virus enters throughmucous membranes of the upper respiratory tract, later affect-ing lungs. [3]. In the majority of cases, COVID-19 is a mildillness, while some people develop severe diseasecharacterised by respiratory compromise (dyspnoea; respira-tory rate ≥ 30 breaths per minute; blood oxygen saturation ≤93%; PaO2:FiO2 < 300; and/or pulmonary infiltrates on >50%of lung fields on radiological imaging) [4]. A minority ofpatients develop critical disease with septic shock or respira-tory and/or multi-organ failure.

Diabetes is asso-ciated with increased morbidity and mortality risk from pneu-monia [9], and hyperglycaemia on admission for pneumonia(>11 mmol/l) predicts poor outcome [9]. During the SARSepidemic in 2002/2003, diabetes was an independent predictorof mortality risk (OR 3.0; 95% CI 1.4, 6.3; p = 0.005) [10].The presence of comorbidities, including diabetes, alsoincreased mortality risk (independent of age) during theMiddle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) epidemic in 2012 (adjusted HR 3.74; 95% CI 2.57,5.67) [11]. In another study, diabetes had the strongest impacton mortality risk among MERS-CoV patients [12]. Similarly,among young patients with novel influenza A (H1N1) in2009, diabetes increased the risk of intensive care unit (ICU)admissions (adjusted OR 4.72; 95% CI 1.81, 12.3) [13].', 'COVID-19 and diabetes', 'Increased risk for severe disease', 'According to the available evidence, people with diabetes donot have a higher susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection[14]. However, observations in the recent COVID-19pandemic are comparable to those from other epidemics, withhigher rates of complications and mortality among patientswith diabetes. Hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery diseaseand cerebrovascular disease were the main associations withsevere disease (present in 23.7%, 16.2%, 5.8% and 2.3%,respectively, of people severely affected by COVID-19) [15]and mortality rate (53.8%, 42.3%, 19.2% and 15.4%, respec-tively, of people who died with the infection) [16].Immunocompromised state, obesity and tobacco smokingare other risk factors for severe disease and death [3, 17, 18].', 'A larger study of 72,314 patients with COVID-19 in Chinaindicated that patients with diabetes had a threefold highermortality rate compared with the mortality rate in COVID-19patients overall (7.3% vs 2.3%) [19]. In Italy, where the overallcase fatality rate is higher (7.2%, compared with 2.3% inChina), among a group of 355 COVID-19 fatalities, 35.5%had diabetes and 30% had ischaemic heart disease [20].', 'Older age, the presence of two or more comorbidities andobesity also predict poor prognosis among COVID-19patients [17, 21]. These are common associations of diabetesand may contribute, at least in part, to the observed increasedrisk. Nevertheless, in a nationwide study of 1590 COVID-19patients in China, after adjusting for age, smoking and comor-bidities, diabetes was an independent risk factor for thecomposite outcome of increased ICU admission, need forventilation and death (HR 1.59; 95% CI 1.03, 2.45; p =0.037) [21]. So far, no published data are available on diseaseseverity among younger patients with type 1 diabetes,although experts in the field have observed it to be similar tothose without [22].', 'Prognostic markers', 'Similar to previous studies among patients with influenza andbacterial pneumonia, elevated serum ferritin, lactate dehydro-genase, C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin and erythro-cyte sedimentation rate (ESR) predicted severe disease amongpatients with COVID-19 [23, 24]. This may indicate second-ary bacterial infection exacerbating COVID-19. Increasedserum ferritin, in particular, might suggest a severe secondarybacterial infection among these patients, thereby making ituseful as a cost-effective prognostic marker [23, 24].Lymphopaenia was also associated with very severe disease[23, 24]. Raised D-dimer levels were observed in severeillness, suggesting a possible consumptive coagulopathy[25], while anticoagulation was linked to decreased mortalityrate in COVID-19 patients [26].', 'Among 174 COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China, peoplewith diabetes had a greater inflammatory response (higherCRP, ESR and IL-6, and relative neutrophilia andlymphopaenia), higher incidence of coagulopathy (higher D-dimer levels), metabolic derangements (hyperglycaemia,transaminitis), severe pneumonia (higher radiological scores)and higher mortality rate, compared with those without [27].However, people with diabetes in this study were older andhad higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease. It is notewor-thy that diabetes itself is a proinflammatory and prothromboticstate [28]. The data indicate that COVID-19, at least in itssevere forms, is a state of severe inflammation and thrombotictendency, so those with diabetes may be predisposed to suchintense immune dysfunction resulting in severe late disease.This is further supported by the observation that renal andcardiovascular comorbidities, which add to the proinflamma-tory state, further worsen the outcome [27].', 'Elevated N-terminal pro-brain-type natriuretic peptide(NT-proBNP) and cardiac troponin I (cTnI), were significantlycorrelated with severe disease, suggesting that COVID-19may lead to myocardial injury and impair cardiac function[15]. In people with diabetes and pre-existing ischaemic heartdisease, limited cardiac reserve may increase morbidity andmortality risk.', 'ACE2, SARS-CoV-2 and diabetes', 'The receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 uses hostACE2 for fusion of viral and host cell membranes [29].ACE2 is a type 1 integral glycoprotein highly expressed inthe kidney, endothelium, lungs and heart [30]. ACE2 convertsangiotensin I and II to angiotensin-(1–9) and angiotensin-(1–7), respectively (Fig. 1). The latter acts as a vasodilator and hasanti-inflammatory and cardioprotective effects. According to', 'Diabetologiaanimal studies, expression of ACE2 in lung tissues is lowunder normal conditions [31], but is upregulated during lunginjury [32]. In fact, some animal studies [33] and pilot studiesin humans [34] have suggested a potential therapeutic role ofACE2 against inflammatory acute lung injury. Furthermore,SARS-CoV (the virus responsible for the 2002/2003 SARSepidemic) appears to downregulate ACE2 expression ininfected cells, and this is thought to perpetuate the inflamma-tory injury [35].', 'In 2003, patients with SARS had higher rates ofhyperglycaemia on admission than non-SARS pneumoniapatients, irrespective of their pre-morbid glycaemic status,disease severity or glucocorticoid use [10]. SubsequentlySARS-CoV was shown to bind to ACE2 in pancreatic isletcells, damage them and cause acute hyperglycaemia, possiblycontributing to an excessive mortality rate, even among peoplewithout diabetes [36]. A similar mechanism may operate inSARS-CoV-2 infection, contributing to hyperglycaemia,excess complications and mortality rate.', 'Although ACE2 shares some characteristics with ACE1, itis not inhibited by ACE inhibitors (ACEI). In fact, ACEI andangiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) upregulate ACE2expression [37]. Therefore, it has been postulated thatACEI/ARB use might facilitate infection with SARS-CoV-2,resulting in severe disease [38, 39]. Furthermore, ACE2 genepolymorphism has been linked to increased risk of diabetesand cardiovascular disease and this may also predict suscep-tibility to severe CoV infection [39]. By contrast, upregulatedACE2 may increase levels of angiotensin-(1–7), mounting ananti-inflammatory effect. However, low angiotensin II levels(due to ACEI inhibition) may mitigate this benefit. Thus it isstill unclear what the balance between benefit and risk mightbe in continuing or stopping ACE inhibition [32].', 'Clinical presentation and diagnosis', 'Following an incubation period of 2–14 days (median 5 days),the majority of people with COVID-19 will present with', 'Organ injury', 'Lung, kidney, heart Pancreatic islet cells', 'Insulin deficiencyCell surface proteinBinds to CoV RBD', 'Facilitates entry into cellsAngiotensinogen ', 'Renin ', 'Angiotensin I ', 'Angiotensin II', 'ACE1 ACE1', 'ACE2 ', 'ACE2 ', 'Angiotensin-(1–9) ', 'Angiotensin-(1–7) ', 'AT2 receptor AT1 receptor Mas1 ', 'VasodilationAnti-proliferative', 'VasoconstrictionPro-proliferative', 'Anti-inflammatoryAnti-proliferative', 'Vasodilation', 'Fig. 1 Role of ACE2 in the pathogenesis of coronavirus diseases. ACE2converts angiotensin I and angiotensin II to angiotensin-(1–9) and angio-tensin-(1–7), respectively. ACE2 is also expressed in the lung, kidney,heart and pancreas and acts as a facilitator for CoVentry into cells. Use ofACEI/ARBs increases angiotensin I levels and upregulates ACE2 geneexpression. This facilitates excess viral entry into host cells causing organinjury and insulin deficiency, contributing to hyperglycaemia.Upregulated ACE2 may convert angiotensin II to angiotensin-(1–7).', 'The latter acts on the Mas1 receptor to trigger anti-inflammatory effectsand inhibits the AT1 receptor to cause vasodilation. However, at least inACEI users, angiotensin II levels will be low and the net benefit of ACE2upregulation is uncertain.

In such situations serial capillaryblood sugar monitoring can be adopted [47]. The use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), includingibuprofen, for symptom relief has raised several concerns; itssuppressive effect on immune response is thought to delayrecovery, while salt and water retention could worsen lunginjury [48]. NSAIDs are also thought to upregulate ACE2(see previous section ‘ACE2, SARS-CoV-2 and diabetes’)[39].', 'Glycaemic control The importance of good glycaemic controlduring the COVID-19 pandemic is emphasised [49]. As this isa new viral infection, the data are limited and so expert recom-mendations conform with strategies used in similar epidemics[47]. Patients with mild COVID-19 can bemanaged with theirusual glucose-lowering agents as long as they are able to eatand drink satisfactorily. Patients should adhere to the ‘sick dayrules’ for people with diabetes [50], and frequent monitoringof capillary glucose is important. Patients who develop severeillness are likely to need treatment modifications. Multiplefactors including glycaemic status, haemodynamic stability,nutritional status, renal function, risk of hypoglycaemia, druginteractions and the availability of medications influence thedecision making. There are specific concerns in relation toglucose-lowering agents when used in patients withCOVID-19 (Table 1). Metformin may be stopped in patientswho are hospitalised and acutely ill, owing to the risk of lacticacidosis [51]. In severe COVID 19 infection, the hypoxic statemay further increase the risk of lactic acidosis.', 'Although there are no specific data on sodium–glucosecotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor use during COVID-19infection, it is advisable to withhold these during acute illnessbecause of the increased risk of dehydration and euglycaemicketoacidosis [52, 53], as well as difficulties in maintainingusual perineal hygiene. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptoragonist (GLP-1RA) therapy should probably be temporarilydiscontinued in patients with haemodynamic instability(which compromises absorption from subcutaneous sites),renal dysfunction, and gastrointestinal dysfunction (whichprevents adequate oral intake). Treatment with GLP-1RAsmay cause gastrointestinal side effects, predisposing tovolume depletion and aspiration [54]. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4(DPP4) inhibitors are associated with low risk ofhypoglycaemia and are relatively safe across a wide range ofrenal functions. DPP4 inhibitors added to basal insulinimprove glycaemic control without increasing the risk ofhypoglycaemia, even among hospitalised patients [55].However, these agents are likely to be of less therapeuticbenefit in patients with severe COVID-19.While patients withmild symptoms could continue DPP4 inhibitors, these shouldbe omitted in acute severe illness and replaced with insulin ifthis becomes necessary. During a severe illness, fine control ofblood glucose is difficult when using sulfonylureas. In suchpatients, sulfonylureas should be replaced with insulin.Caution with sulfonylureas also needs to be exercised if chlo-roquine is considered, because of risk of hypoglycaemia withboth. Thiazolidinediones (e.g. pioglitazone) are a lessfavourable option for in-hospital management of acutely illpatients, because of fluid retention and oedema. They arecontraindicated in patients with haemodynamic instability, orhepatic or cardiac dysfunction, which may be seen in severeCOVID-19 infection [56].', 'Existing evidence favours insulin over other glucose-lowering agents for glycaemic control in hospitalised patients.For non-critically ill hospitalised patients, subcutaneous', 'Table 1 The use of pharmacotherapies for diabetes and related comor-bidities during COVID-19', 'Therapy Considerations for useduring COVID-19', 'Suggestions for practice', 'Metformin Risk of lactic acidosis inhypoxia and acute illness', 'Stop if severely ill withhaemodynamicinstability or hypoxia', 'SGLT2inhibitors', 'Increased risk ofdehydration andeuglycaemicketoacidosis', 'Stop if oral intake is nottolerated or severely ill', 'GLP-1RAs Gastrointestinal side effectsand risk of aspiration', 'Stop in severely ill patients', 'DPP4inhibitors', 'Low risk ofhypoglycaemia; possibleto use for a wide range ofrenal function', 'May be continued innon-critically ill patients', 'Sulfonylureas Risk of hypoglycaemia iforal intake is poor orwith concomitant use ofhydroxychloroquine orchloroquine', 'Stop if unable to maintainregular oral food intakeor at risk ofhypoglycaemia', 'Pioglitazone Risk of fluid retention andoedema; contraindicatedin haemodynamicinstability', 'Stop if severely ill withhaemodynamicinstability, or hepatic orcardiac dysfunction', 'Insulin Requires frequentmonitoring due to risk ofhypoglycaemia', 'Drug of choice in criticallyill patients (see text)', 'ACEI/ARBs Uncertain risk of increasedsusceptibility forinfection and uncertainbenefit in mitigatinginflammatory injury', 'Continue use unless aspecific contraindicationarises (hypotension,hyperkalaemia, acutekidney injury)', 'Aspirin Risk of cardiovasculardisease higher duringCOVID infection', 'Continue for patients onaspirin for secondaryprevention unlesscontraindications arise', 'Statins Possibility of increased riskof transaminitis andmyositis', 'Individualised decision onrisk and benefit', 'Diabetologiainsulin therapy with basal or intermediate-acting insulin givenonce or twice a day, along with mealtime boluses of short- orrapid-acting insulin, is the preferred strategy for glycaemicmanagement [57]. Sliding scale therapy should probably notbe practiced as this results in greater fluctuations and pooroverall control [58]. For critically ill patients, insulin therapyshould be initiated with a glycaemic target of 7.8–10 mmol/l(140–180 mg/dl) [59]. Less stringent glycaemic control withtarget glucose concentrations >10 mmol/l (180 mg/dl) may beacceptable in terminally ill patients, in patients with severecomorbidities, and in patient care settings where frequentglucose monitoring or close nursing supervision is not feasi-ble. Less aggressive insulin regimens aimed at simplyminimising glucosuria, dehydration and electrolyte distur-bances may be justifiable in such patients. Although thereare no strict guidelines regarding the insulin regimen forglycaemic control in critically ill patients, intravenous insulininfusions and short or rapid-acting insulin boluses may beused.

To date, no clear evidence exists for or against theuse of ACEI/ARBs in people with diabetes at risk or infectedwith SARS-CoV-2, despite the speculations for potentialadverse effects [39]. There are clear competing risks in stop-ping, since the control of hypertension and the protectionagainst renal disease may be compromised.

The novel pathogen was an enveloped RNA-beta-coronavirus-2named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), with phylogeneticsimilarity SARS-CoV (1). Initially, the outbreak was reported starting from a zoonotictransmission in live animal and seafood market. It soon became apparent that efficient person-to-person transmission was also occurring (2). The disease has rapidly spread fromWuhan to otherareas. By March 11, 2020, the WHO (World Health Organization) declared the pandemic status (3).Globally, up to February 3, 2021, there have been 103.201.340 confirmed cases of COVID-19,including 2.237.636 deaths, reported to COVID-19 Dashboard by the Center for Systems Scienceand Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University.', 'Considering the rapid spread and high mortality rate of COVID-19, it is necessary to evaluate thepossible risk factors affecting the progression of disease in COVID-19 patients (4).', 'The pandemic has involved millions of persons, and their related chronic conditions could haveprognostic and therapeutic implications. One of the essential chronic conditions is, without anydoubt, diabetes for its impact on hospitalization, mortality, and economic burden. To date, abouthalf a billion people have diabetes worldwide, and the number will increase by 25% in 2030 and 51%in 2045 (5). The prevalence is estimated to be 9.3% (463 million people), rising to 10.2% by 2030 and10.9% by 2045 (5).

Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and COVID-19SARS patients, it is necessary to clarify all the aspects concerningthe links between the two conditions to offer the scientific andclinical community those elements useful to face this pandemicin the best possible way. An extensive search of SCOPUS,PubMed, and CENTRAL was performed using the followingstring “(SARS-Cov-2 OR COVID-19) AND (diabetes ORhyperglycemia)”. The hand-searching of principal generalistand infectious disease Journals was carried out as well. Thisreview aimed to summarize the special aspects of COVID-19infection in people with diabetes and the relation betweendiabetes and COVID-19 in epidemiology, pathophysiology,prognosis, and therapeutics to provide practical and clinicalrecommendations approaching diabetic patients duringthis pandemic.PREVALENCE OF DIABETES AND ITSCLINICAL SEVERITY IN PATIENTSWITH COVID-19', 'Emerging data suggest that COVID-19 is common in patientswith diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases (CVD),even if the prevalence rate changed in different studies andcountry-wise data (6). The rates of type 2 diabetes in subjectsaffected by SARS-CoV-2 vary, depending on the median age, theseverity of illness, the location of the study population, and themethod of testing.', 'Table 1 shows a synthesis of various studies from an extensivesearch on bibliographic citation databases (7–16) that exploredthe prevalence of diabetes according to the type of study,population, sample size, age, sex, and prevalence of diabetes,hypertension, and obesity.', 'Data show that the prevalence of diabetes and sex differences(with a higher prevalence of men than women), increasesaccording to the increase of median age. A similar trendregarded hypertension. Current evidence indicates that fatalityrates are higher in men than in women. A report on April 23,2020, from the Italian National Institute of Health, shows that ofFrontiers in Endocrinology | www.frontiersin.org 223.188 deaths from COVID-19 infection in Italy, approximately70% were in men (17). Besides, our previously published data inelderly inpatients (18, 19) have shown a higher prevalence ofdiabetes in men than women. This evidence might explain thehigher prevalence of diabetes in elderly patients affected byCOVID-19. It could justify an exclusively epidemiologicalassociation between diabetes and COVID-19 and not thevirus’s ability to affect diabetic patients specifically.', 'There are two other aspects to consider: how much doesdiabetes affect clinical severity? Since its relationship to, howdoes obesity? Some data might clarify these issues.', 'Firstly, U.S.A. Centers for Disease Control and Preventionreported data for laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infectionsin the United States from February 12 to March 28, 2020. Dataregards 7,162 subjects with completed case information andrevealed a prevalence rate for diabetes of 6%, 24%, and 32%,for non-hospitalized, hospitalized but not requiring intensivecare unit (I.C.U.) admission vs hospitalized in the I.C.U.,respectively (20). In Italy, a diabetes prevalence of 17% wasreported in patients admitted to intensive care units for severeCOVID-19 (16). Recent data confirmed the findings mentionedabove, outlining a diabetes prevalence of 18.3% in English peoplewith severe COVID- 19 requiring critical care treatment (highdependency unit or intensive care unit) (21). Other study showeda significant prevalence of diabetes (30.05% vs 19.57%) in deadpatients compared to survivors in ICU wards in Spain (22).Moreover, Du and colleagues reported a prevalence of 35.3% ofdiabetes in Wuhan’s ICU patients (23). In summary, diabetesresulted associated with a dramatic increase in mortality (OR3.62; 95% CI 2.11–6.2; p<0.0001) and emerged as an independentrisk factor even after correcting for age, race, sex, obesity, andhypertension (24).', 'Secondly, prevalence rates of diabetes (31.8% vs 5.4%) andobesity (39.8% vs 14.5%) were more significant in thehospitalized vs non-hospitalized subgroups, respectively (12).Additionally, a BodyMass Index (B.M.I.) >40 was among the riskfactors most predictive of the need for hospitalization (OR 6.2,95% CI, 4.2-9.3) (12). In addition, obesity represented by B.M.I.has still increased the mortality (obesity class I HR 1.23; obesityTABLE 1 | Prevalence of type 2 diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease in various studies on COVID-19 patients.', 'Authors Type of study Population N ofpatients', 'Age(median)', 'Female(%)', 'Diabetes(%)', 'H.T.N.(%)', 'Obesity(%)', 'Liang W. et al.

Severe obesity (BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2),increasing age, and male sex are independently associated withmortality and need for intubation and increasing oxygenrequirements during hospitalization (26). An analysis of 124consecutive I.C.U. admissions in a single center in Lille, Francefrom February 27 to April 5, 2020, revealed higher obesity ratesand severe obesity among SARS-CoV-2 patients, relative tohistorical no SARS-CoV-2 controls. In this observational study,the frequency of obesity was 47.5% compared to 25.8% in acontrol group of I.C.U. individuals with the non-SARS-CoV-2illness. In subjects affected by obesity, the requirement forintubation and mechanical ventilation was higher (27).', 'Moreover, obesity increases the risk of hypoventilationsyndrome in I.C.U. patients and it can lead to respiratoryfailure when ARDS is present (28–33). The likely mechanismsthat explain these effects are poorly understood, but mechanicaland inflammatory factors might contribute. At the same time, wehave shown that obesity (especially the visceral type) isassociated with low levels of adiponectin, which could be thelink to explain the increased cardiovascular risk in patients whopresent the association between obesity and COVID-19 (34–36).Finally, according to Crouse et al., 74% of diabetic patients wereobese, which may have contributed further to the increased riskobserved in this population (24). Given the knownepidemiological relationship above mentioned, both conditions’coexistence can be considerate a “cumulative” risk factor fordisease severity.DIABETES AS A RISK FACTOR OFWORST OUTCOMES', 'In general, people with diabetes are at higher risk of developingcomplications because of infection, particularly viral one. Thedifferences in response are likely the result of the degree of viralload, host immune response, age of the patient, and presence ofcomorbidities. The higher risk of mortality and complicationsamong people with diabetes was similar in the two other recentcoronavirus outbreaks, the SARS and the Middle East respiratorysyndrome (MERS) (37). Type 2 diabetes is associated with low-grade chronic inflammation induced by the excessive visceraladipose tissue. This inflammatory condition affects thehomeostatic glucose regulation and peripheral insulinsensitivity. Chronic hyperglycemia and inflammation candetermine an abnormal and ineffective immune response (37).', 'Diabetic patients with COVID-19 are at higher risk of beingin an excessively hypercoagulable state and uncontrolledinflammation responses, which may contribute to a pooreroutcome (38).', 'In particular, a known history of diabetes and a fasting plasmaglucose ≥ 7.0 mmol/l before steroid treatment were independentpredictors of death with an increased risk (odds ratio) of 3.0 and3.3, respectively (39).', 'In a recent study on 132 patients with type 2 diabetes, anegative linear correlation between SaO2 and HbA1c was found.At the same time, there was a positive linear correlation betweenFrontiers in Endocrinology | www.frontiersin.org 3serum ferritin, C-Reactive Protein, Fibrinogen, and Erythro-Sedimentation Rate levels and HbA1c, especially with HbA1c ≥7.5% (40).', 'Developing data also suggest that COVID-19 patients withdiabetes are more often associated with severe or critical diseasewith a percentage ranges from 14-32% in different studies(41–45).', 'Wu et al. (46) reported a hazard ratio (H.R.) of 2.34 (95% CI,1.35 to 4.05; p=0.002) for the acute respiratory syndrome(ARDS) in a sample of 201 diabetic patients with COVID-19.', 'However, in their meta-analysis (n=46,248), Yang et al.reported that the odds ratio (OR) of severe COVID-19 was notsignificantly higher in people with diabetes (OR, 2.07; 95% CI,0.89 to 4.82), unlike hypertension (OR, 2.36; 95% CI, 1.46 to3.83) (9).', 'The lower prevalence of diabetes might explain this finding,and the lower age of the populations studied. Another meta-analysis of 9 studies from China (n=1936) by Chen et al. found asignificant association between COVID-19 severity and diabetes(OR, 2.67, 95% CI; 1.91 to 3.74; p<0.01) (47). Curiously, theprevalence of non-survivors was also higher in diabetic subjectswith COVID-19 (42, 48, 49). Also, a summary report of 44,672patients of COVID-19 from the Chinese Center for DiseaseControl and Prevention reported a case fatality rate (C.F.R.) of2.3% (1023 deaths among 44,672 confirmed cases). In any case,the C.F.R. was as high as 7.3% in patients with diabetes and 6.0%in hypertension (50).', 'However, conflicting data exist. Indeed, in univariate analysisof 191 patients with COVID-19, Zhou et al. (48) found thatdiabetes had an OR of 2.85 (95% CI, 1.35 to 6.05; p<0.001) for in-hospital mortality. Nevertheless, the association of diabetes andmortality was no longer significant after a multivariate regressionanalysis showing an independent and positive relationship withage, SOFA score, and D-Dimer levels.', 'In 174 consecutive patients confirmed with COVID-19, databetween diabetics and non-diabetics were compared according tosigns and symptoms, laboratory findings, and chest computedtomography. Patients with diabetes had no significant differencesin gender and age, less fever (59.5% vs 83.2%), more nausea andvomiting (16.7% vs 0%), and higher mortality (16.7% vs 0%) incomparison with patients without diabetes.', 'The absolute counts of neutrophils and some inflammation-related biomarkers’ serum levels are much higher than thosewithout diabetes, such as IL-6, serum ferritin, E.S.R., C.R.P, andD-dimer. Beyond that, the absolute count of lymphocytes, redblood cells, and haemoglobin level was significantly lower in thediabetes group than in the non-diabetes group. It is crucial tooutline that the levels of enzymes such as L.D.H., a-hydroxybutyrate-dehydrogenase, A.L.T., and G-GT, indicatingthe injury of myocardium, kidney, and liver were even higher inpatients with diabetes than patients without diabetes. These dataprovide a clue that the injure of organs was much more severe inthe diabetics group than those without diabetes (38).', 'Finally, even when chest computed tomography (C.T.)imaging of COVID-19 patients with or without diabetes wascompared, the latter showed more severe pathological changesMarch 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 609470https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/endocrinologyhttp://www.frontiersin.org/https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/endocrinology#articles', 'Corrao et al. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and COVID-19than the former. To confirm this, the diabetes group presentedhigher C.T. imaging scores in comparison with the non-diabetesgroup (38).', 'Proposal of Pathogenetic MechanismsThere are several specific factors and mechanisms by whichdiabetes predisposes to infections in general and may increasesusceptibility or risk and severity of SARS-CoV-2 disease.Potential mechanisms that may enhance the susceptibility forCOVID-19 diabetics include the role of hyperglycemia, higheraffinity cellular binding, and efficient virus entry, decreased viralclearance, diminished T cell function, increased susceptibility tohyper-inflammation, cytokine storm syndrome, and presence ofCVD (51).THE ROLE OF HYPERGLYCEMIA', 'The susceptibility to SARS appears to be primarily dependent onthe spike’s affinity to bind host ACE2 receptors (ACE2r) in targettissues in the initial viral attachment step (52).', 'ACE2r has been confirmed recently as the SARS-CoV-2internalization receptor causing COVID- 19, in concert withthe host’s TMPRSS2 membrane protease that primes the spike Sprotein of the virus to facilitate its cell entry (53).', 'A possible explanation for a link between hyperglycemia andACE2r levels in the severity of COVID- 19 disease could be thepotential changes in glycosylation of the ACE2r andglycosylation of the viral spike protein.', 'Both possibly resulting from uncontrolled hyperglycemiamay alter the viral spike protein binding to ACE2r and thedegree of the immune response to the virus (54). Elevatedglycemia levels can directly increase glucose concentrations inairway secretion (55). According to Brufsky, potentially, inuncontrolled hyperglycemia, high and aberrantly glycosylatedACE2r in the lung, nasal airways, tongue, and oropharynx couldalso serve as increased SARS-CoV-2 viral binding sites, thusleading to a higher trend to COVID-19 infection and a moresevere form of the disease (54). This indicates the presence ofstress hyperglycemia (i.e., a temporary increase in blood sugar inpatients with A1C <6.5% after acute illness or surgery) (56),which may have a worse outcome in acute illness, compared to apreviously diagnosed diabetes. Given that stress hyperglycemiapatients have observed similar worse results in the previousmeta-analysis, this finding is not unexpected (57, 58). Stresshyperglycemia was one of the poor prognostic factors and hadbeen associated with a significant increase in respiratory failureand death in subjects with SARS (59).', 'Glycemic control could reduce levels of glycosylated ACE2rtarget in the lung. In this way, the number of glycosylated viralbinding sites decreases, possibly ameliorate inflammation andsymptoms of COVID-19 disease (54). ACE2r is expressed notonly in type I and II alveolar epithelial cells in the lungs andupper respiratory tract, but also in several other locations like theheart, endothelium, renal tubular epithelium, intestinalepithelium, and pancreas (54).Frontiers in Endocrinology | www.frontiersin.org 4Within the pancreas, ACE2 expression has been described inacinar cells and within subsets of islet cells. In preclinical studies,gain and loss of ACE2 function reveal physiological andpharmacological roles for ACE2, both dependent andindependent of Angiotensin (1-7), which may antagonize theactions of angiotensin II in glucose control and cell function,renal physiology, blood pressure, atherosclerosis andamelioration of experimental diabetes (60, 61).', 'An acute viral respiratory infection has been linked to therapid development of transient insulin resistance, both inotherwise healthy euglycemic normal weight or overweightindividuals (62).', 'This link suggested a mechanism of transient hyperglycemiainduced by a temporary inflammation of the pancreas’ islet cellsby SARS-CoV through SARS-CoV binding to the ACE2r presenton islet cells, resulting in a transient insulin-dependent diabetesmellitus, which resolved with the resolution of disease (63).', 'Hyperglycemia may also affect pulmonary function, such thatit is exacerbated by influenza virus-induced respiratorydysfunction in patients with diabetes. In animal models ofdisease, diabetes is associated with numerous structuralchanges to the lung such as augmented permeability of thevasculature and a collapsed alveolar epithelium (64).', 'Until a short time ago, whether D.M. was causally linked toACE2r expression levels in the lung in humans was unknown.Rao et al., by a phenome-wide Mendelian randomization study,explored diseases that may be causally linked to increased ACE2expression in the lung, showing that diabetes was causallyassociated with increased lung ACE2 expression (65).', 'Despite a possible role of TMPRSS2 in the viral pathogenicity,little information is available about the regulation ordysregulation of TMPRSS2 expression or activity by glucose inthe context of experimental or clinical diabetes. In patients withdiabetes, higher circulating glucose levels will result in a higherpercentage of glycated haemoglobin. SARS-CoV-2 surfaceproteins seem to bind to and potentially impair the hememolecule within red blood cells. In this way, a separation ofiron from the molecule to form a porphyrin occurs, determiningin red blood cells less oxygen and carbon dioxide carriage,thereby generating cell death and intense inflammation inthe lung.', 'Because patients with diabetes and older people have moreglycated haemoglobin, they may be preferentially affected bySARS-CoV-2 binding and dissociation of iron from heme toform porphyrins, and another receptor (CD147 or basigin)might be involved (66).IMPAIRED T-CELL FUNCTION ANDINCREASED SUSCEPTIBILITY TOHYPERINFLAMMATION', 'The activation of proinflammatory cytokines or chemokinescauses infected cells apoptosis or necrosis and triggersinflammatory responses, which leads to the recruitment ofinflammatory cells.

Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and COVID-19production, CD4 T helper (Th1) cells are involved in regulatingantigen presentation against intracellular pathogens such asCoV. The recruitment of neutrophils and macrophages isinduced by Th17 cells by producing interleukin-17 (IL-17),IL-21, and IL-22 (67).', 'SARS-CoV-2 increases apoptosis of lymphocytes (CD3, CD4,and CD8 T cells) and infects circulating immune cells leadingto lymphocytopenia.', 'Lower T cell function diminishes the inhibition of innateimmune system resulting in the secretion of high amounts ofinflammatory cytokines. This phenomenon is called “cytokinestorm” (68). Neutrophil chemotaxis, the intracellular killing ofmicrobes, and phagocytosis were inhibited by diabetes. In thebeginning, a delay in the activation of Th1 cell-mediatedimmunity and a late hyper-inflammatory response is oftenobserved in diabetics (69).', 'In line with this evidence, in patients with COVID-19, thenumber of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are low. However, a higherproportion of highly pro-inflammatory Th17 CD4+ T cells,along with elevated cytokine levels was present. It is possible tospeculate that patients with D.M. may have weakened anti-viralI.F.N. responses, and the delayed activation of Th1/Th17 mayaccentuate inflammatory responses (51).', 'Several cytokines are increased in COVID-19 infection. Atbaseline, cytokines such as TNF, IL-1, and IL-6 are more active indiabetics and subjects affected by obesity. Therefore, it is believedthat SARS-CoV-2 infection may enhance the cytokine responseof such patients, thereby exacerbating the cytokine storm thatseems to cause multiple organ failure in COVID-19 (33, 70).', 'The baseline proinflammatory state found in diabetes andobesity may serve to exacerbate this. Diabetes occurs in partbecause the increase of activated innate immune cells inmetabolic tissues leads to the overproduction of inflammatorymediators, especially IL-1b and TNFa, which can promotesystemic insulin resistance and b cell damage (9).THERAPEUTICAL CONSIDERATIONS', 'MetforminIn preclinical studies, metformin exerts anti-inflammatory actionand reduces circulating biomarkers of inflammation in peoplewith T2D (71). However, there is scant information about theimmunomodulatory actions of metformin in the context ofcoronavirus infection. Recent data showed that the use ofmetformin significantly reduced the odds of dying. People testedpositive who were taking metformin had an 11% risk of dying,which was the same as the general COVID-19 population anddramatically lower than 24% mortality of subjects with diabetesnot taking metformin. Interestingly, even after correcting forinsulin use, age, race, sex, obese status, and hypertension status,the likelihood of death in subjects with T2D taking metformin wassignificantly lower than those who did not take metformin (OR0.33; 95% CI 0.13–0.84; p=0.0210) (24).', 'Anyway, metformin should be used with caution in unstablehospitalized patients and should be discontinued in people withFrontiers in Endocrinology | www.frontiersin.org 5concomitant sepsis or severe impairment of hepatic and renalfunction (72). If vomiting or poor oral intake occurs, metforminmay also be stopped. Due to the level of blood sugar, the dosageof sulfonylureas and insulin may have to be changed (6).GLP-1R AGONISTS', 'GLP-1R agonists exert broad anti-inflammatory actions inanimals with experimental inflammation and reducebiomarkers of systemic inflammation in human subjects withT2D and people with obesity (73). It is well known that the mostsevere form of COVID-19 is the Acute Respiratory DistressSyndrome characterized by the highest levels of inflammatorycytokines known as “Cytokine Storm” which hurts alveolarepithelial cells in the lung, inactivates pulmonary surfactantresulting in the formation of the hyaline membrane and lungparenchyma breakdown.', 'Different preclinical studies showed that GLP-1R agonistsattenuate pulmonary inflammation, reduce cytokine productionand preserve lung function inmice and rats with experimental lunginjury (74, 75) through the stimulation of pulmonary vasodilatorlike atrial natriureticpeptide and facilitationof surfactant proteinA.GLP-1R agonists exert the repression of the proinflammatorycytokine, the stimulation of eNOS/sGC/PKG signaling and causethe inactivation of the NF-kB signaling. In addition, in the LPS-induced acute lung inflammatory injury mouse model, liraglutideattenuates the expression of key inflammasome components, suchas thioredoxin-interacting protein (TxNIP) significantly increasedafter the administration of lipopolysaccharide (L.P.S.) along withcytokines and chemokine genes (73).', 'These beneficial effects could identify GLP-1-based drugs asfundamental tools for treating COVID-19 patients with orwithout diabetes. Although GLP-1 safely lowers blood glucoseof ventilated patients with critical illness in short term studies,there is still insufficient safety and experience in using GLP-1Ragonists in critically ill patients, and it is impossible to maketreatment recommendations for the use of these drugs in newcoronavirus infection (76).', 'In our opinion, GLP-1R agonists must not be suspended ifpreviously prescribed. Moreover, further studies need to evaluatethe beneficial effect as the first prescription in diabetes patientswith COVID- 19.DIPEPTIDYL PEPTIDASE-4 (DPP4)', 'Recently, coronavirus’s relationship to cellular type-IItransmembrane protein DPP4, also known as adenosinedeaminase complexing protein 2 or cluster of differentiation 26(CD26), has generated a great interest. Just as ACE-2 is thereceptor for SARS CoV and SARS CoV2, DPP4 acts as thereceptor for MERS-CoV. Whether the use of DPP4 inhibitors(DPP4i) can reduce MERS-CoV’s viral entry has aroused greatinterest. In vitro study, sitagliptin, vildagliptin, and saxagliptindid not prevent the coronavirus from entering the cell (74).March 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 609470https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/endocrinologyhttp://www.frontiersin.org/https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/endocrinology#articles', 'Corrao et al. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and COVID-19Briefly, DPP4i seem to increase inflammation in type 2diabetes via catalytic and noncatalytic mechanisms. It is crucialto outline that the enzymatic activity of DPP4 causes the cleavageand may affect the function of several chemokines, cytokines,and growth factors (37).', 'However, in patients with type 2 diabetes, the effects of DPP4inhibition on the immune response is controversial and notcompletely understood. A meta-analysis showed that DPP4inhibitor treatment does not increase significantly upperrespiratory tract infections. Compared with placebo or activecomparator treatment, risks of respiratory infection for DPP4iwere all comparable. The initiation of a DPP4 inhibitor was notassociated with an increased risk of respiratory tract infections.On the contrary, anti-inflammatory and anti-adipogenic effectshave been related to the use of DPP4 inhibitors and GLP-1receptor analogues (37). In fact, gliptins can preserve endothelialfunction by their reported anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, andpotentially protective effects on the vascular system, which arebeneficial aspects in the fight against COVID-19 (77).INSULIN', 'Insulin exerts anti-inflammatory actions in humans and reducesbiomarkers of inflammations in hospitalized individuals with acritical illness. Among available agents for the treatment of acutedisease complicated by diabetes, insulin has been the mostextensively used agent in human subjects with bacterial or viralinfections and in hospitalized critically ill patients. Mosthospitalized patients with COVID-19, especially those withrespiratory distress, would require insulin.', 'However, there is little information surrounding the potentialbenefits or risks of insulin in the context of acute coronavirusinfection (75, 76). On the other hand, one should consider theimportance of maintaining a reasonable glycemic control in thispatient. This statement may be remarkably faithful to the light ofrecent evidence that showed, in a sample size offifty-nine patients,that insulin infusion is beneficial for achieving glycemic targetsand improving outcomes in patients with COVID-19 (78).SGLT2-INHIBITORS', 'Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) aredemonstrated to have cardiovascular and renal benefits inaddition to its anti-diabetic effects (79). Clinical experimentsshowed that the combined use of SGLT2i and ACEI/ARBsignificantly increases intrarenal ACE2 expression, which maybe closely related to improving cardiac and renal function (80).However, the increased ACE2 may be detrimental to patientsinfected with the coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19), whichis found to invades cells via the entry receptor of ACE2. Besides,SGLT2i induced natriuretic effect may also increase the risk ofacute kidney injury and affect hemodynamic stability duringsystemic infection (81). SGLT2i have been reported to preventthe release of various proinflammatory cytokines such as IL 6.Frontiers in Endocrinology | www.frontiersin.org 6Besides, SGLT2i lead to an increase in the ACE-2 levels, whichleads to greater production of the angiotensin 17, which is apotent vasodilator, anti-oxidant, and anti-fibrotic, which helps inthe prevention of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)and alleviating cytokine storm (82). This may have a putativerole in COVID-19 patients with myocarditis and adverse cardiacremodeling. SGLT2i also downregulates the expression ofinflammatory genes and reduces oxidative stress, leading tocardiorenal dysfunction’s amelioration (83).A.C.E. INHIBITORS/A.R.B.S', 'In the absence of further evidence of risk or benefit, the AmericanHeart Association, the American College of Cardiology, and theAmerican Society of Hypertension have recommended thatpeople continue treatment with their usual antihypertensivetherapy ACE-inhibitors or ARBs (84). According to a recentstudy (13), the use of A.C.E. inhibitors in COVID-19 patients,was associated with lower mortality after hospital discharge (noassociation was found for the use of A.R.B.s). Whether there is animmunosuppressive state, the presence or absence ofhyperlipidemia or diabetes mellitus and the race or ethnicgroup were not independent predictors of death in the hospital.STATINS', 'Besides their lipid-lowering activity, statins exert pleiotropiceffects on inflammation and oxidative stress, contributing totheir beneficial impact on cardiovascular diseases. Statinsmodulate the immune response at different levels, includingimmune cell adhesion and migration, antigen presentation,and cytokine production.', 'Statins also interfere with ACE2 signaling. After initial entrythrough ACE2, SARS-CoV-2 down-regulates ACE2 expression,possibly facilitating the initial infiltration by innate immunitycells and causing an unopposed angiotensin II accumulation,leading to organ injury.', 'Furthermore, in COVID-19 infection, statins’ lipid-loweringaction could treat the hyperlipidemia associated with the use ofprotease-inhibitor-based antiretroviral and immunosuppressivedrugs. The hepatic isoenzyme CYP3A4 metabolizes simvastatinand, to a lesser extent, atorvastatin. Concomitant administration ofCYP3A4 inhibitors such as ritonavir and cobicistat, currently usedin COVID-19, could increase the risk of muscle and liver toxicity.', 'Therefore, starting with a lower dose of statin and monitoringcreatine kinase and transaminases would be advisable (85).', 'Moreover, the same problem occurs with azithromycin. Thesame study above mentioned (13) pointed out the statins as anindependent protective factor for survival to hospital discharge.CLINICAL CONSIDERATION', 'Data reported in our review support the notion that diabetesshould be considered as a risk factor not only for increasedMarch 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 609470https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/endocrinologyhttp://www.frontiersin.org/https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/endocrinology#articles', 'Corrao et al. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and COVID-19susceptibility to infection but also for a rapid progression andbad prognosis of COVID-19. Therefore, according topathophysiological consideration, people with diabetes shouldbe paid more intensive attention to the importance ofglycosylation of both the viral spike protein and ACE2r.', 'This consideration argues for better glycemic control in patientswith hyperglycemia at hospital admission. Pre-diabetes anddiabetes are potential mechanisms to slow the spread of COVID-19 and reduce symptoms and improve outcomes. We know thatblood glucose control is essential for patients with COVID-19 andthose without the disease. Nevertheless, hyperglycemia is still apowerful predictor of the prognosis of hospitalized Covid-19patients. Besides, Covid-19 patients with hyperglycemia,compared with subjects normoglycemia, showed a highercumulative incidence of serious diseases. In addition, optimalblood glucose control mediated by insulin infusion can improvethe prognosis of hospitalized Covid-19 and hyperglycemic patients(78). Patients with mild infections, and regular oral doses cancontinue routine hypoglycemic drugs. However, in today’s world,with an unprecedented pandemic, the treatment of diabetespresents challenges. In most places, people are confined to “closedareas”, exercise opportunities are limited, and they cannot takeregular walks and visit gyms or swimming pools. Due to theunpredictability and social nature of the disease, mental stress isalso great. Do not move as well as social immobility. Alterations inthe daily routine affect dietary intake as well. Stress could lead toinappropriate eating. All these factors may lead to uncontrolledglycemia or worsening status of comorbid diseases (e.g.,hypertension) and predispose the patients to complications likeother types of infections, hyperosmolar coma, ketoacidosis, andeven acute cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events (6).', 'In this sense, telemedicine could come to assistance. In aCochrane review, Flodgren and colleagues analyzing 21randomized controlled trials of 2768 patients with diabetesshowed that a significant reduction of HBA1c by -0.31%(p < 0.001) was present in patients on telemedicine incomparison with controls (86). In a recent systematic reviewand meta-analysis which included patients with type 2 diabetesmellitus and type 1 diabetes mellitus Timpel and colleaguesshowed that there was a mean reduction in HbA1c levels intype 1 (-0.12 to -0.86%) and type 2 diabetes patients (-0.01% to-1.13%) included in the telemedicine intervention group (87).', 'According to this view, it is possible to summarize measuresfor good health in patients with diabetes:Frontiers in Endocrinology | www.frontiersin.org 7• Diabetics need to maintain a regular diet.• According to the American Diabetes Association (88),exercises should be continued at home.• Physical activity improves blood glucose control in type 2diabetes (aerobic exercise increases muscle glucose uptake upto fivefold through insulin-independent mechanisms),reduces cardiovascular risk factors, contributes to weightloss. Adults affected by type 2 diabetes should ideallyperform both aerobic and resistance exercise training foroptimal glycemic and health outcomes (89).Structured lifestyle interventions including at least 150 min/week of physical activity and dietary changes are recommendedto promote weight loss of 5%-7% and to prevent or delay theonset of type 2 diabetes in people at high risk and with pre-diabetes.• Regular intake of ACE2-inhibitors and other antihypertensiveand anti-diabetic drugs (including GLP1-R agonists) and, ifnecessary, insulin is important and should be emphasized forthe best blood pressure glucose control.• Telemedicine can be beneficial in these times. Patients canconsult their physicians via telemedicine, who can giveappropriate advice about treatment (90).', 'In conclusion, COVID-19, due to its heterogeneity, can beconsidered a systemic disease as it is more than a single-organdisease (4). The association with diabetes makes the wholecondition at a higher risk of poor outcomes. For this reason,from now on, diabetes care has to include a careful, holisticevaluation of all the patients affected by COVID-19.DATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT', 'The original contributions presented in the study are included inthe article/supplementary material.

Diabetes mellitus is one of commonest noncommu-nicable diseases associated with worsening clinical status in COVID-19 patients. Summary: The aim of this review was to evaluate the receptors and pathogenetic link between dia-betes and COVID-19. Both disease conditions involve inflam-mation with the release of inflammatory markers. The roles of angiotensin-converting enzyme molecule and dipeptidyl peptidase were explored to show their involvement in CO-VID-19 and diabetes. Pathogenetic mechanisms such as im-paired immunity, microangiopathy, and glycemic variability may explain the effect of diabetes on recovery of COVID-19 patients. The effect of glucocorticoids and catecholamines, invasion of the pancreatic islet cells, drugs used in the treat-ment of COVID-19, and the lockdown policy may impact negatively on glycemic control of diabetic patients. The out-come studies between diabetic and nondiabetic patients with COVID-19 were also reviewed. Some drug trials are still ongoing to determine the suitability or otherwise of some drugs used in diabetic patients with COVID-19, such as dapa-gliflozin trial and linagliptin trial. © 2020 The Author(s)', 'Published by S. Karger AG, Basel', 'Introduction', 'Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a viral infec-tious disease caused by the coronavirus, severe acute re-spiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [1]. It is a single-stranded, enveloped RNA virus named after its crown-like surface projections seen on electron micros-copy [2]. COVID-19 has similar clinical features as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East re-spiratory syndrome (MERS), and the viruses belong to the family Coronaviridae and of the subfamily Corona-virinae[2]. They have greater similiarities in their struc-tural and biochemical constituents. The symptoms in-clude fever, cough, respiratory difficulty, myalgia, gastro-intestinal features, and a myriad of other symptoms.', 'This article is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License (CC BY-NC-ND) (http://www.karger.com/Services/OpenAccessLicense).

The mortality arising from the disease is low and occurs in the severely ill patients. Mild to moderately ill patients make up about 80% of the cases. Since the onset of the disease, the number of deaths has been on the rise [4].', 'Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disorder that currently affects about 422 million persons worldwide [5]. COVID-19 and diabetes are both associated with acute and chronic inflammation, respectively. Both dis-ease conditions can impact each other in terms of clinical progression and outcome. Therefore, it becomes impera-tive to review studies on the effect of these diseases on each other and the pharmacological approach in the management of diabetes coexisting with COVID-19.', 'Pathogenesis of COVID-19COVID-19 is a viral infectious disease with a predilec-tion for the respiratory system. The infection is spread by respiratory droplets. The incubation period, which is the duration from the time of exposure to the development of symptoms, is 2–14 days [6]. The incubation period in-forms the duration of quarantine period for those who have contact with exposed victims.', 'Zoonotic exposure was the mode of transmission of initial cases recorded in China. However, subsequent cas-es were obtained through human-to-human transmis-sion via droplets in aerosols [7]. Transmission is also pos-sible via some hospital procedures such as bronchoscopy, endotracheal intubation, and tracheostomy.', 'The respiratory system is initially affected, giving rise to pneumonic changes. The binding of the coronavirus S-glycoprotein to the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor in the host with subsequent fusion with the cell membrane initiates the viral entry [8]. The S-gly-coprotein is composed of S1 and S2 subunits which are situated on the surface spikes of the virus [9].', 'Furin, a protease which enhances viral entry, has been documented to be elevated in diabetic patients. The en-hancement of viral entry is through the cleavage of S1 and S2 domains of the surface spike proteins [10]. Favorable factors for viral replication in the cytosol include an acid-ic environment and the presence of proteases such as ca-thepsin [11].', 'The inflammatory changes are initiated in the respira-tory system with generation of multiple cytokines and chemokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-α; interleu-kin-1, 7–10; interferon gamma; granulocyte colony-stimulating factor; granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimu-lating factor; fibroblast growth factor 2; monocyte che-moattractant protein-1; and macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha [12]. Some laboratory features include leukocytosis in most cases, although leukopenia can also be found. Inflammatory markers such as erythrocyte sedimentation rates and C-reactive proteins were elevat-ed in the serum of COVID-19 patients. C-reactive pro-tein was significantly associated with the progression to severe forms of COVID-19 (OR 1.056; CI 1.025–1.089;  p < 0.001) [13].', 'Pathogenesis of DiabetesDiabetes mellitus is caused by either absolute insulin lack in type 1 diabetes or insulin resistance in type 2 dia-betes [14]. Chronic hyperglycemia is the main metabolic derangement in diabetes and gives rise to glucotoxicity to body tissues with the formation of advanced glycation end products [15]. These mechanisms are responsible for the chronic complications of diabetes. Lipotoxicity also plays a role.', 'Acute complications of diabetes include diabetic keto-acidosis (DKA) and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar states [16]. Hypoglycemia is a complication of treatment which is mainly noted with insulin or sulfonylurea use. The commonest precipitating factor in DKA and hyperglyce-mic hyperosmolar states is infection which increases the body’s insulin requirements resulting in uncontrolled hy-perglycemia. Chronic hyperglycemia predisposes to in-fections and the latter also worsen hyperglycemia, thus initiating a vicious cycle [17].', 'The role of inflammation in diabetes has been de-scribed. The association between inflammation and dia-betes was made based on the identification of inflamma-tory markers such as C-reactive proteins, IL-6, plasmino-gen activator inhibitor-1, tumor necrosis factor-α, leptin, and adiponectin [18, 19].', 'Interrelationship between Diabetes and COVID-19 Infection at Receptor LevelDipeptidyl Peptidase-4Incretins such as glucagon-like peptide and gastric in-hibitory peptide are known to be defective in type 2 dia-betic patients. They enhance insulin secretion. However, these incretins can be degraded by dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) in the intestinal tract, thus potentially reducing their activities. DPP4 is a transmembrane glycoprotein which exists as a dimer in active state and has a molecu-lar mass of 220 kDa [20]. DPP4 inhibitors inhibit the ac-tivity of this degrading enzyme, thus enhancing the ca-pacity of incretins in insulin secretion. They include ', 'COVID-19 and Diabetes Mellitus:  The Link and Clinical Implications', '71Dubai Diabetes Endocrinol J 2020;26:69–77DOI: 10.1159/000511354vildagliptin, saxagliptin, sitagliptin, linagliptin, teneli-gliptin, and trelagliptin [21].', 'This same enzyme has been implicated as a compo-nent of an entry receptor for the coronaviruses: human coronavirus-Erasmus Medical Center [22] and MERS-CoV [23]. DPP4 was originally referred to as CD26 [20]. However, the site of DPP4 in coronavirus pathogenesis is located in the bronchial tree [22]. Human coronavirus-Erasmus Medical Center has genetic resemblance to oth-er coronaviruses.', 'In an animal study by Iwata Yoshikawa et al. [24], transgenic mouse models were made susceptible to MERS-CoV by expressing DPP4. Type 2 diabetes was in-duced in the mice using high-fat diet. The DPP4 mice fed with high-fat diet developed hyperglycemia and hyperin-sulinemia (which are the initial stages in the pathogenesis of type 2 DM). When the DPP4 mice were infected with MERS-CoV, they had severe viral infection with delayed recovery and weight loss which were independent of viral titers [25].', 'Since MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 belong to the same subfamily of Coronavirinae, it is possible that the effect of diabetes on the viral infections may be similar. This requires elucidation from future research works.', 'Does the above implication mean better efficacy of DPP4 inhibitors in diabetic patients with COVID-19? A clinical trial (NCT04341935) is ongoing with the aim of determining the efficacy of linagliptin in diabetes control and reduction in the severity of COVID-19 infection [26]. The primary completion date is October 30, 2020.', 'ACE2 ReceptorACE2 receptor is very vital in SARS-CoV-2 entry into the cells. The receptor is sufficiently expressed by the ep-ithelial cells of the lungs, intestine, kidney, and vessels [27]. Li et al. [28] showed that patients with diabetes also express high concentrations of ACE2 and its level is sig-nificantly raised in those taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor block-ers (ARBs). The hypothesis that ACE2 polymorphisms are linked to some noncommunicable diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, stroke, and genetic predisposition to developing SARS-CoV 2 infection has been postulated [29, 30].', 'SARS-CoV-2 infectivity is related to the rate of shed-ding of ACE2. Lambert et al. [31] showed that A disinte-grin and metalloproteinase 17 (ADAM17) is capable of shedding the ecto-domains of some membrane-bound cell adhesion molecules and cytokines such as ACE2 mol-ecule. The extracellular domain of ACE2 forms the recep-tor for the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2, and this is the basic site for the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infec-tion [32]. This was demonstrated using phorbol myristate acetate, which caused the transformation of ACE2 with a molecular weight of 120 kDa to a polypeptide of 105 kDa and the proteolytic shedding of the ACE2 enzymatic ac-tive ecto-domain [31]. Thus, inhibition of ADAM17 re-sults in the reduction of proteolytic shedding of the ACE2 ecto-domain and eventually increases the rate of entry and infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 [33]. The finding is from laboratory animals but yet to be replicated in humans. The inhibitors of ADAM17 include tissue inhibitory me-talloproteinase-3 and insulin [34, 35]. Another protease, transmembrane protease serine 2 antagonizes the effect of ADAM17 and enhances the cellular uptake of soluble SARS-CoV2 entry through the cleavage of ACE2 [36].', 'ACEi and ARBsACEi and ARBs are important antihypertensive med-ications that are widely used in patients with hyperten-sion and diabetes. They are known to increase cardiac ACE2 [37]. In view of the role of ACE2 in COVID-19 pathogenesis, it is important to detect effects of these drugs on the severity of the disease. Most authors still hold the opinion that despite the theoretical knowledge of increased ACE2 with ACEi or ARBs, there is not enough practical evidence from large population studies to refute their use in patients with hypertension and dia-betes [38, 39]. Chen et al. [40] showed that the clinical outcomes in COVID-19-positive patients with coexisting diabetes and hypertension who use ACE inhibitor or an-giotensin II receptor blocker were comparable to those not using the drugs.', 'A clinical trial (NCT04318418) was designed to deter-mine the effect of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers on the severity of COVID-19 infec-tion [41]. It was a retrospective case-control study with a target study population of 5,000 participants. The study was completed on April 30, 2020, but the outcome is not yet published.', 'Effect of Diabetes on COVID-19 InfectionsPatients with diabetes mellitus have increased predis-position to viral and bacterial infections including those affecting the respiratory tract [42]. One of the mecha-nisms responsible for this predisposition is the “lazy” leu-kocyte syndrome, which represents impaired leukocyte function of phagocytosis (impaired immunity). This fur-ther emphasizes the likelihood of increased propensity of SARS-CoV-2 infections in diabetic cohorts [43].', 'Ugwueze/Ezeokpo/Nnolim/Agim/Anikpo/Onyekachi', 'Dubai Diabetes Endocrinol J 2020;26:69–7772DOI: 10.1159/000511354', 'Microangiopathy in diabetes mellitus also impairs the lung compliance with consequent affectation of the gas-eous exchange. This impairment may result in the prolif-eration of some respiratory pathogens including SARS-CoV-2 [44]. There are respiratory changes in diabetic pa-tients that affect lung volumes and pulmonary diffusing capacity [45].', 'Muniyappa and Gubbi [43] summarized the potential mechanisms through which diabetes increases the SARS-CoV-2 morbidity and mortality: (i) increased cellular binding affinity and efficient viral entry, (ii) decreased vi-ral clearance, (iii) reduced T-cell function, and (iv) in-creased susceptibility to hyper-inflammation and cyto-kine storm. In the present COVID-19 pandemic, a study done in Italy showed that diabetes mellitus ranks high among the comorbidities in patients with COVID-19. Systemic hypertension and ischemic heart disease were also common among the comorbidities noted in the pa-tients [46].', 'A study done in Wuhan on the characteristics of CO-VID-19 patients showed that patients with diabetes mel-litus accounted for 2–20% of positive cases and also con-stituted about 7.1% of ICU admissions [12]. Yang et al. [47] and Cheng et al. [48] also demonstrated a prevalence of 17 and 12.1%, respectively, among 52 and 99 corona-virus-positive cases in China. However, some parameters such as glycated hemoglobin and the presence of chronic diabetic complications were not reported.', 'A similar study done in New York among 5,700 hos-pitalized patients with COVID 19 showed that 1,808 pa-tients (33.8%) were diabetic, 3,026 (56.6%) had systemic hypertension, while 1,737 (41.7%) were obese [49]. This study generally emphasized the impact of noncommuni-cable diseases on COVID-19 infection.', 'Glycemic variability is a prognostic factor in diabetic patients with COVID-19 infection. Hyperglycemia wors-ens the outcome by the process of cytokine storm, endo-thelial dysfunction, and multiple organ injuries [50]. In the lungs, the primary target of COVID-19, hyperglyce-mia leads to a rapid deterioration in spirometric func-tions, especially decreased forced expiratory volume in 1 second and forced vital capacity [51]. Phillips et al. [52] showed that in hyperglycemic states, there is elevated glu-cose concentration in the respiratory epithelium which may affect its innate immune capacity. Hypoglycemia also increases cardiovascular mortality by accentuating monocytes which are pro-inflammatory and enhancing platelet aggregation [53]. Severe hypoglycemia which may occur with strict glycemic control may worsen the overall mortality rate [54].', 'Bode et al. [55] demonstrated that suboptimal glyce-mic control in COVID-19 patients is correlated with higher mortality rate. The mortality was 28.8% in the dia-betic group compared to 6.2% in the nondiabetic group.', 'Effect of COVID-19 on DiabetesCOVID-19 infection compounds the stress of diabetes mellitus by releasing glucocorticoids and catecholamines into circulation. These worsen glycemic control and in-crease the formation of glycation end products in many organs and worsen prognosis [56].', 'Does COVID-19 Have Any Direct Effect on the Pancreas?Some authors have considered the rapidity of worsen-ing glycemic control in stable diabetic patients with CO-VID-19 requiring the use of high insulin dose and sug-gested the possibility of pancreatic invasion by the SARS-CoV-2 [57, 58]. The above perspective has been supported by the finding of high levels of ACE2 in the pancreatic islet beta cells which may cause increased islet cell injury and impaired insulin secretion [59]. Wang et al. [60] demonstrated that 9 (17%) of 52 admitted patients in Wuhan with COVID-19 pneumonia developed pan-creatic injury as evidenced by abnormality in serum amy-lase or lipase levels. Six of the affected 9 patients with pan-creatic injury also developed glucose intolerance. After viral entry into the beta cells, there is a downregulation of ACE2 leading to increased angiotensin level, which also impairs insulin secretion [61]. Possible mechanisms of pancreatic injury include (i) direct cytopathic effect of SARS-CoV-2 replication, (ii) systemic response to respi-ratory failure, and (iii) harmful immune response in-duced by SARS-CoV-2 infection [60].', 'Effect of CorticosteroidsCorticosteroids such as hydrocortisone are used to sup-press inflammation. In severe cases, methylprednisone (in the dose of 1–2 mg/kg/day) is used to control cytokine storm [62]. However, results showed no specific benefit but some complications such as worsening diabetes, avas-cular necrosis, and psychosis [63]. The use of corticoste-roids may raise blood glucose by 80% in diabetic patients with COVID-19 infection and to a lesser extent in those without diabetes [64]. This has resulted in increased mor-tality in patients with coronavirus infection. In conditions where corticosteroids are needed, then blood glucose mon-itoring is vital to maintain near euglycemia and achieve optimal pulmonary and immunologic functions [65].', 'COVID-19 and Diabetes Mellitus:  The Link and Clinical Implications', '73Dubai Diabetes Endocrinol J 2020;26:69–77DOI: 10.1159/000511354', 'LockdownA policy was implemented in many countries in a bid to flatten the infective curve of COVID-19. The effect of such policy led to limited access of many diabetic patients to their diets, exercise, drugs, and routine hospital check-up. This resulted in worsening glycemic control with eventual development of acute and chronic complica-tions of diabetes [66].', 'Outcome Studies of Type 2 Diabetic and Nondiabetic Population with COVID-19 InfectionThe degree of inflammatory response to COVID-19 is more marked in diabetic patients than in nondiabetic co-horts. The study by Zhu et al. [67] showed that type 2 diabetic group had higher levels of inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein and procalcitonin (57.0 and 33.3%) than the nondiabetic group (42.4 and 20.3%), re-spectively. Elevated C-reactive protein may serve as a marker for identifying those with high risk of death from COVID-19 [40]. The D-dimer which is a marker of co-agulation status was also elevated in the diabetic group compared to the nondiabetic group (50.5 vs. 33.3%). The levels of these inflammatory markers have been corre-lated with the severity of COVID-19 infection [68].', 'A derivation from the higher degree of inflammation and coagulation in diabetic-COVID patients shows that they required more integrated and intensive manage-ment than the control group. In the study at Hubei in China, among 952 participants with pre-existing type 2 diabetes, noninvasive ventilation was employed in 10.2% of diabetic patients as against 3.95% in the nondiabetic group [67]. Similarly, invasive ventilation was used in 3.6% of the diabetic group compared to 0.7% in the non-diabetic group.', 'The COVID-19 and Diabetes Outcomes (CORONA-DO) study (NCT04324736) in France was a prospective observational trial aimed at determining the phenotypic characteristics of diabetic patients admitted for COV-ID-19 infection [69]. The study findings showed that among 1,317 participants, 382 (29%) required tracheal intubation or died within 7 days on admission, while 18% were discharged. Only BMI was independently associated with severity of COVID-19, while HbA1C, use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockers, and DPP4 in-hibitors were not. Other variables such as age and micro-vascular and macrovascular diabetic complications were associated with risk of early death. The impact of obesity on the frequency of use of mechanical ventilation was also demonstrated by Simonnet et al. [70].', 'Does COVID Infection Affect the Choice of Antidiabetic Drugs?The ideal antidiabetic medications used in DM pa-tients with coexisting COVID-19 infection should not only lower blood glucose but should also not worsen the prognosis of COVID-19 infection. There is paucity of data on the ideal antidiabetic medication in COVID-19 patients with diabetes. Some findings concerning antidia-betic medications are discussed below.', 'InsulinInsulin exhibits inhibitory action on ADAM-17 [35]. ', 'ADAM-17 enhances the proteolytic shedding of the en-zymatic active ecto-domain of ACE2 in laboratory ani-mals [31]. This may suggest that insulin increases the ac-tivity of ACE2 [35] and also increases the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 but is yet to be substantiated in humans. The beneficial effect of insulin may be related to its anti-inflammatory effect, which is by suppression of pro-in-flammatory cytokines and increased immune mediators [71]. Sardu et al. [72] showed that insulin use achieved better glycemic control in 25 diabetic patients with CO-VID-19, where the mean glycemia during hospitalization was 10.65 ± 0.84 and 7.69 ± 1.85 mmol/L in non-insulin- and insulin-treated groups, respectively (p < 0.001) [73]. Posttreatment plasma glucose was still significantly lower in the insulin-treated group (p < 0.001). Recommenda-tion by a body of experts is that insulin should be used in diabetic patients with COVID-19, especially hospitalized patients [58]. In order to reduce exposure of health-care workers to coronavirus, the use of continuous glucose monitoring has been effectively utilized [73].', 'Conversely, a recent study by Chen et al. [40] among 136 (120) diabetic patients of 904 clinically diagnosed COVID patients showed that insulin users compared to non-insulin users in the diabetic cohort were associated with poor prognosis (OR 3.58; 95% CI 1.37–9.35; p = 0.009). The finding of Chen et al. [40] requires validation from further meta-analytical studies.', 'MetforminI. The ACE2 receptor is very vital in SARS-CoV-2 en-try into the cells. Phosphorylation of the receptor renders it nonfunctional. Metformin can achieve the phosphory-lation of ACE2 receptor via activation of adenosine mo-nophosphate kinase [74]. The resultant effect is reduction in the binding capacity of the virus due to steric hindrance by incorporation of PO4–3 molecule.', 'Once the entry of the virus is established, there is a downregulation of ACE2 receptor and a corresponding ', 'Ugwueze/Ezeokpo/Nnolim/Agim/Anikpo/Onyekachi', 'Dubai Diabetes Endocrinol J 2020;26:69–7774DOI: 10.1159/000511354activation of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which is responsible for the cardiac and pulmonary com-plications of COVID-19 infection [75]. Since metformin inhibits the viral entry into the cell by disruption of bind-ing capacity, it may be considered beneficial in COV-ID-19 infection.', 'II. Inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Metformin inhibits mTOR via activation of ad-enosine monophosphate kinase in the liver and liver ki-nase B1. mTOR plays a significant role in the pathogen-esis of influenza viruses, but this has not been document-ed in COVID-19 [74].', 'However, despite these beneficial mechanisms at the molecular levels, metformin is not recommended in the clinical management of COVID-19 infection. This is due to the risk of lactic acidosis, which may ensue in diabetic patients with dehydration from acute viral infection [58] and worsen hyperglycemic emergencies in hospitalized patients. Worsening dehydration may also result in prer-enal acute kidney injury.', 'SulfonylureasDue to poor caloric intake in acute infections, the use of sulfonylureas may induce hypoglycemia. It is not ideal in the management of hyperglycemia in COVID-19 [76]. This is the case especially in ICU admissions.', 'Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 AgonistsLiraglutide enhances ACE2 levels in cardiac and pul-monary tissues of rats [77]. However, similar effect is not replicated in humans. Although there may be possibility of a poor outcome from its usage, this is yet to have a prac-tical significance.', 'ThiazolidinedionesPioglitazone has been shown to reduce the level of ', 'ADAM-17 in human skeletal muscles [78]. The drug also potentiates the effect of ACE2 which was noticed in rats [79]. The tendency to cause fluid retention and worsen heart failure makes pioglitazone unsuitable in patients with both diabetes and COVID-19.', 'DPP4 InhibitorsThe anti-inflammatory property of DPP4 inhibitors may mitigate the effect of COVID-19 on glycemic con-trol. They do not potentiate ACE levels in mice, and thus may be considered beneficial in diabetic patients with COVID-19. Bornstein et al. [58] recommended this class of drug in treating hyperglycemia in COVID-19 patients. A clinical trial is ongoing to determine the ef-ficacy of linagliptin in COVID-19 patients with diabetes [26]. A summary of trial with linagliptin is shown in Ta-ble\xa01.', 'Sodium Glucose Transporter-2 InhibitorsSodium glucose transporter (SGLT)-2 inhibitors en-hance renal ACE2 [80] and thus may have poor out-comes, but this is yet to be substantiated in randomized controlled trials.

However, im-provement in the pancreatic beta cell function has been suggested as shown by increased C-peptide response when the drug is administered [83]. Kumar et al. [84] evaluated the efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine when added to stable insulin therapy in combination with metformin and glimepiride in comparison to sitagliptin. After a study period of 24 weeks, HbA1C reduction was 1.3% in the hy-droxychloroquine group and 0.9% in the sitagliptin group (p < 0.001). A greater reduction in fasting plasma glucose of 31.0 mg/dL in the hydroxychloquine group than 23.2 mg in the sitagliptin group was observed. The study, however, did not specify whether the participants in the hydroxy-chloroquine group developed side effects of hydroxychlo-roquine such as retinal impairment, skin reaction, hearing loss, and cardiac arrhythmias, which are notable limita-tions to its use in diabetes [85].', 'The mechanism of action of hydroxychlorquine is by increasing the pH of intracellular milieu which inhibits in-sulin breakdown, thus enhancing its recirculation and ef-fectiveness in hyperglycemic states [86]. However, chloro-quine or hydroxychloroquine is not classified as a typical antidiabetic drug. Hydroxychloroquine is also one of the experimental drugs used in COVID patients. It is used in conjunction with zinc to improve its efficacy [87]. Cheng et al. [40] showed in a multivariate regression analysis that the typical antidiabetic drugs (insulin, secretagogues, met-formin, DPP4 inhibitors, and alpha-glycosidase inhibi-tors) were not associated with in-hospital mortality.', 'Conclusion', 'The knowledge of interaction between diabetes and COVID-19 is still evolving. However, some clearly es-tablished links include the role of ACE2 and increased severity of COVID-19 infection in patients with diabe-tes. The role of DPP4 is implicated in MERS-CoV patho-genesis, so theoretically it may be implicated in SARS-CoV2 also, as they belong to the same subfamily and family. Inflammation has been implicated in both dis-ease conditions.', 'Although some antidiabetic drugs have effects on the cellular entry molecules, randomized controlled trials have not established worsening of diabetes control with these drugs in COVID-19 infection. Antidiabetic drugs that can reduce inflammatory processes and achieve good glycemic control are ideal. Insulin is of special im-portance in managing COVID-19 patients with diabe-tes, especially those who have hyperglycemic emergen-cies or in ICU admission.
